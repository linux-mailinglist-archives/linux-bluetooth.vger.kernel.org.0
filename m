Hi Marcel:
  What I plan to do about adapter power cycle for quality report:

  Step 1: At power off, do not clear the flag of HCI_QUALITY_REPORT in
hci_dev_clear_volatile_flags(). Will use HCI_QUALITY_REPORT to track
if the quality report is enabled before power off. Will also disable
the quality report explicitly in hci_sync.c:hci_dev_open_sync() just
before aosp_do_close()  so that different vendor chips will have
quality off at power off.

  Step 2: In hci_sync.c:hci_dev_open_sync(), re-enable quality report
explicitly just after aosp_do_open() if HCI_QUALITY_REPORT is true so
that all vendor chips have quality back on at power on.

  If the quality report is not enabled before power cycle,
HCI_QUALITY_REPORT will always stay false. Nothing mentioned above
will be executed in this case.

  One thing is worth noting here. The HCI_QUALITY_REPORT represents
the host setting instead of the controller state. During power off,
the HCI_QUALITY_REPORT host setting remains true while the controller
state about quality report is turned off. This behavior is similar to
"wide-band-speech" whose setting remains true during power off.

  Does this sound good to you? If yes, I will append a new patch to
the next Series-version. Thanks!
