Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

BTW: Thx for taking care of this, Luiz!

Hey, this patchset is fixing a regression from 5.16 (see patch 3/4), but
apparently is only scheduled to go upstream in the next cycle, as it was
applied to bluetooth-next.git. The patches also seem to miss tags to get
them backported to stable. Is that intentional? At least patches 1, 2,
and 3 don't look that complex, why can't they get in this cycle and get
backported to stable soon to finally provide a solution for users that
are plagued by this for weeks already?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
