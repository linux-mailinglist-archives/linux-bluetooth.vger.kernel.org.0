This is, IMO, a direct result of poor quality of the qualification
program, especially around HCI contract validation.

We are still collecting the data.  We can share the data around when
we'd be ready to set the driver flag :)

I'm happy to change this into QUIK_VALID_LE_STATES, but I admit that
testing some of the directed advertisement states are beyond the scope
of what I'm comfortable signing up for.
