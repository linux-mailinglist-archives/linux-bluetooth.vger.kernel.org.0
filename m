Yep, in terms of tests the ideal solution would be simulate BAP
qualification tests:

https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=3D524716

Ive started to write them as unit tests:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/unit/test-bap.c

It is somewhat laborious to write all the PDUs manually like that but
if we managed to write all the tests we could perhaps enable it
working with the full stack rather than limiting it bt_bap instance,
but perhaps it is overkill since we could instead automate
qualification tests via auto-pts.

We can do both a hand-coded tests with bthost or hook a second
instance of btdev to BlueZ so we test BlueZ vs BlueZ, well in theory
we could even bring another stack as well like zephyr into the
picture, anyway what we need to know is how to setup the environment
for pipewire and wireplumber, note that we don't have the so called
user session under test-runner environment, so I wonder if we need
wireplumber?
