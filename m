I saw your “mask” proposal and I am not a fan of that. I want to keep the design of the API somewhat consistent. Hence the Device Flags Changed event should be send after Add Device completed and also after Device Added has been sent out.

One other option is to keep Get Device Flags as is and then instead of adding Set Device Flags, add one command per flag and rename Device Flags Changed to New Device Flags.

Set Device Wakeable Command
===========================

        Command Code:           0x004a
        Controller Index:       <controller id>
        Command Parameters:     Address (6 Octets)
                                Address_Type (1 Octet)
                                Wakeable (1 Octet)
        Return Parameters:      Address (6 Octets)
                                Address_Type (1 Octet)
				Current_Flags (4 Octets)

Maybe this is not a bad idea either and is similar on how we handle settings. I need to sleep about this.

Regards

Marcel
