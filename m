We are starting to suspect this is not a new issue, it just become
easier to reproduce with newer kernels since the mgmt commands are now
handled by a different work/thread which probably takes longer to
respond hitting problems such as:

https://github.com/bluez/bluez/issues/275#issuecomment-1020608282

This has been fixed by:

https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/faad125c5505b941f06c54525616e192a6369208
https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/5f378404bff6bbfea3f20e36535c494efa5066a5

So the timer doesn't start until the request is sent. but obviously
older versions of userspace don't have that fix so they end up
cancelling the loading of LTKs, this would explain why reloading the
daemon would make it work again.
