In 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/commit/?id=713f6f09 a 
flag named "external" was added which, if I'm understanding correctly, 
is supposed to mark the Battery1 profile as safe to also share via GATT. 
  However, I was recently working on an application that relies on the 
GATT API for battery power and found that it only seemed to work as 
expected (reporting via both) if I set the flag to false rather than 
true as in the commit.  I looked through the code and it all looks 
correct, but my observation indicates that perhaps the sense of the flag 
is somehow inverted.

Here's the project I was working on, with the relevant bug report.
https://github.com/AsteroidOS/libasteroid/issues/13

So can someone verify that:
1. the interface is intended to be shared via GATT and Battery1
2. that it does not work that way today
