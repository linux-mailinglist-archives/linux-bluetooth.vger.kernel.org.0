currently the stepping for mSBC and CVSD are hard-coded in esco_param_cvsd and esco_param_msbc arrays in hci_conn.c and then selected by the ->setting parameter.

So either we provide an new socket option (for example BT_VOICE_EXT) or we extend BT_VOICE to allow providing the needed information. However this needs to be flexible array size since we should then be able to encode multiple stepping that are tried in order.

My preference is that we extend BT_VOICE and not introduce a new socket option. So feel free to propose how we can load the full tables into the SCO socket. I mean we are not really far off actually. The only difference is that currently the tables are in the hci_conn.c file and selected by the provided voice->setting. However nothing really stops us from providing the full table via user space.

The ulaw and alaw air codecs are in theory possible, but nobody in the history of Bluetooth has used them. So just ignore that part of the specification. For air codecs you have either CVSD or transparent. And then with transparent you get mSBC and AuriStream.

That is true, but still for transparent codec they defined a new alternate setting for USB.
