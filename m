also introduce a Read Mesh Features command. And things like Available Slots should go there.

I would call this Set Mesh Receiver. I think we are going to reconfigure this at runtime for different AD types depending on our mode.

However I do not get the Active part. I don’t want any Mesh Receiver that set the device to active scan. That is crazy. If you for some reason want active scanning, then enable the mesh receiver and start a discovery procedure. If the mesh receiver is marked as active it should report out any mesh packet, no matter how it got it. However for basic mesh operation we will do passive scanning.

We also need to introduce scanning parameters via the settings so that we can overwrite the defaults.

I think trying to bundle receiving with sending is a bit pointless and too much of a policy. Let userspace handle that.

I would call this Transmit Mesh Packet.

For the Reference, I am not convinced it is a good idea to have this come from userspace. We have to take extra care then of checking for duplicates or other weird things. Let the kernel just return a reference that can be used. I also tend to call this Handle.

You are also missing then the Mesh Packet Transmission Complete event.

I think we should also include the Address and Address_Type and let userspace generate these. Or at least allow it specify one and only let the kernel generate one in case of BDADDR_ANY. I want to give this API a chance to survive in case newer specs want to play with using RPAs.

We need to think about if the Instant might be better as 64-bit value or if we want to handle the 32-bit overrun internally.
