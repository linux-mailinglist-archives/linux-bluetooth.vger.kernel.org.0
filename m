For clarification, I mean here that constructs like

	conn = hci_conn_hash_lookup_handle(hdev, handle);
	if (!conn)
		return 0;
	do_something(conn);

might not be safe if e.g. hci_event.c is doing hci_conn_del on another
CPU at the same time (it appears to be in hdev->workqueue, cmd_sync in
req_workqueue so I'm not sure they are serialized), and frees conn
after hci_conn_hash_lookup_handle exits the critical section,
before/during do_something runs. Something like

	rcu_read_lock();
	conn = hci_conn_hash_lookup_handle(hdev, handle);
	if (conn)
		handle = conn->handle;
	rcu_read_unlock();
	if (!conn)
		return 0;
	do_something(handle)

could avoid that, or holding hdev->lock (IIUC in hci_sync callbacks it
is not automatically held).

Or, maybe there is some other guarantee that can be assumed here, and
I'm missing something about how the locking/scheduling works here
(don't know this well enough).

The other comment was about if

	hci_cmd_sync_cancel(hdev, -ECANCELED);

could cancel the wrong command. Note conn->state is set to BT_CONNECT
in hci_connect_le, before hci_connect_le_sync sends its command, so if
there was already another command in the hci_sync queue belonging to a
different connection, it seems hci_cmd_sync_cancel might here cancel
the wrong one.
