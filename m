That makes the assumption that the path doesn't ever change which is
something we never required for the endpoints, besides can be clashes
if the same path is used in which case the stored value would be
ambiguous, so I prefer to just have the endpoint id, if we are so
eager to detect endpoint changes we can save some hash/unique id
generated but I think it is a bit overkill if this is working as it
currently is and we can always fallback if we cannot recover the last
used, anyway this is not even supported by the spec since it has no
guarantees regarding peers endpoints uniqueness.
