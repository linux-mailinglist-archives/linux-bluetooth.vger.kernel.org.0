I am using the disconnect reason to mark the device for reconnection
and only queueing it for reconnect on resume. As mentioned in the
patch, this is to account for resumes that are not user driven and
will suspend almost immediately again (i.e. periodic wake up to check
battery level and see if we need to shut down).

Sure, I will rename this.

So the first reconnect attempt after resume should be separately
configurable (i.e. 5s) but subsequent reconnect attempts would use the
reconnect-intervals values? That sounds good to me.
