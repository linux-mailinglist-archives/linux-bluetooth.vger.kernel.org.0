Hi Tedd,

> This patch set refactors the multiple setup routines for various Intel devices
> to a combined single entry. Here are the highlight of the changes:
> 
> 1. Updated hci_alloc_dev() to allocate the hdev object with an extra buffer
>   for the private data. btintel introduces the btintel_data struct and
>   store it to the private data in hdev object.
> 
> 2. Added a single entry for setup and shutdown and uses the
>   HCI_Intel_Read_Version command to identify the device, instead of
>   relying on the USB VID and PID. The new HCI_Intel_Read_Version command
>   is used for both legacy ROM, legacy Bootloader and TLV based bootloader.
> 
>   Also, btintel_configure_setup() is added to setup the most of hdev
>   callbacks, unless it is a transport specific functions.
> 
>   After identifying the device, it calls the corresponding setup routines.
>   These routines were copied from btusb to btintel and changes are none or
>   very minimal.
> 
> 3. Keep the state of bootloader in btintel object. The bootloader state
>   is agnostic to the transport type, so btintel uses the btintel_data
>   to keep track of the state in the private data section in hdev.
> 
>   Also, added macros to set/clear/test flags to simplify the code.
> 
> 5. Cleaned up the exported functions and make it static as much as possible
>   if not necessary.
> 
> 6. From the JfP/ThP, the operational firmware support the new TLV based
>   HCI_Intel_Read_Version command, which confues the usage during the
>   setup routine. So, the check for firmware variant of those legacy
>   bootloader sku is added to use the legacy bootloader setup call.
> 
> 7. All of HCI quirks for Intel devices are moved in the setup routines.
>   There are several HCI quirks for Intel devices and some of them are
>   for all Intel devices and some of them are for a specific devices.
> 
>   The flag for HCI quirks are removed from the .driver_info, and applying
>   HCI quirks are done in combined setup routine depends on the hw_variant.
> 
> 8. Combined the setting the MSFT extension support in the combined setup
>   routine now depends on the hw_variant.
> 
> 
> Tedd Ho-Jeong An (12):
>  Bluetooth: Add support hdev to allocate private data
>  Bluetooth: btintel: Add combined setup and shutdown functions
>  Bluetooth: btintel: Refactoring setup routine for legacy ROM sku
