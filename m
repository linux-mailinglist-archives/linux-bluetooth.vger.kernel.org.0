hmmm. The enabled portion you need to explain a bit more. I don’t see the need for it right now.

Similar to the Read Advertising Features, I would at least add the Num_Handles and a Handle list so that you know what handles you have.

I do wonder if you should do a Max_Handles or Max_Pattern information here as well.

Lets say “based on pattern matching”. I would try to avoid Microsoft HCI extension as explicit mentioning in the API description if possible.

Unless our Advertising or Connection Handle in the Bluetooth Core spec are 32-bit, I would like to stay with a 16-bit value here.

This sentence doesn’t really parse.

Lets keep this simple, if there is at least one monitor enabled, then the kernel will trigger scanning.

When the Monitor_Handle is set to zero, then all previously handles are removed. Make this similar to Remove Advertisement.

We also should not that in case of pattern monitor, all patterns associated with a monitor handle will be removed.

Besides these minor details, I think this look good.
