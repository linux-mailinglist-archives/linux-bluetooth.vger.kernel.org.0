Marcel, as I said in first email, to use one specific AuriStream codec,
kernel needs to set following SCO properties:

  syncPktTypes =3D 0x003F
  bandwidth =3D 4000
  max_latency =3D 16
  voice_settings =3D 0x63
  retx_effort =3D 2

And to use hardware encoder (e.g. mSBC), kernel needs to userspace allow
to set all parameters for "Enhanced Setup Synchronous Connection" HCI
command.

Otherwise userspace cannot use hardware encoder/decoder.

I do no know how to create more minimal interface as one which I
proposed to allow usage of both AuriStream and also in-hardware
encoders/decoders.

If you do not like my proposed API for it, could you please show me
different solution for API which would allow userspace applications
(e.g. pulseaudio) to use AuriStream codec and also would be able to use
in-hardware encoder/decoders? So pulseaudio would not have to use own
software encoder/decoder when bluetooth adapter supports it in HW?
