Looking at the kernel code (hci_event.c) a =E2=80=9CPIN or Key =
missing=E2=80=9D encryption error should cause a unique =
MGMT_DEV_DISCONN_AUTH_FAILURE disconnection reason to be presented in =
the mgmt Device Disconnected event. So that could be one way to identify =
this in user space. That said, I think a better way would be to add some =
configurable policy to the kernel to decide what to do in such a case. =
This is also a security sensitive scenario, since the reason you get =
=E2=80=9CPIN or Key missing=E2=80=9D could be because someone is =
pretending to be the real device, i.e. they could force you to drop the =
keys for the real device without any authentication. So to be safe, the =
old keys should only be discarded when the new pairing has been =
successful, and the security level of the new pairing should be at least =
as strong as the old one. I don=E2=80=99t think this is doable in user =
space with the current design.
