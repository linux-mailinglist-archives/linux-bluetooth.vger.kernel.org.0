your side? Today i am very much happy to inform you about my success in
getting those inheritance funds transferred under the co-operation of a new
partner from India Asia. He is a Canadian but based in India, but presently
i'm in India for investment projects with my own share of the total sum of
millions dollars. meanwhile, i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts
to assist me in transferring those inheritance funds despite that it failed
us some how, i want you to contact my secretary in Lome Togo Republic West
Africa, her name is solomon brand, this is he email address (
solomonbrand003@gmail.com ), ask her to contact Ecobank were i
kept the sum of $350,000.00, for your compensation, this compensation fund
is for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in the passed
transaction. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. so feel
free and contact my secretary Mr solomon brand, and instruct her where
Ecobank will transfer the total sum of $350,000.00.

Please do let me know immediately Ecobank transfer the fund $350.000.00
into your own bank account, in the moment, I am too busy here because of
the investment projects which i am having with my new partner at hand, so

contact Ecobank on your behalf without any delay. Stay safe of Covid 19.

Best regards,
