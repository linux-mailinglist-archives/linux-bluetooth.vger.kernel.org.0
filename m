  hog-lib: Don't restrict Report MAP size

Although HIDS spec is quite clear the Report MAP shall be limited to
512 bytes it doesn't seem OS do enforce that on the profile/client side
and since there isn't any qualification test enforcing it either there
are quite many devices which uses Report MAP bigger that 512 bytes
(e.g.: Brydge W-Touch and Lenovo Duet 3 BT Folio).

waiting for Disconnect Complete event so instead just use SHUT_WR to
start the disconnect procedure without causing the socket to HUP.

checked when the socket HUP to confirm the remote has properly
disconnected (e.g. received Disconnected Complete).

  adapter: Reset pending settings when receiving MGMT error

We set the pending settings flag when sending MGMT_SETTING_*
commands to the MGMT layer and clear them when receiving a
successful reply, but we don't clear them when receiving an error
reply. This might cause a setting to be stuck in pending state.

Therefore, also clear the pending flag when receiving error.
Furthermore, this patch also postpones setting the pending flag
until we queue the MGMT command in order to avoid setting it too
soon but we return early.

This was caught during power off test, where MGMT_OP_SET_POWERED
returns Authentication Failed because disconnection takes too long.
Future attempts to switch power will then be ignored.
