i will add comments within hci_qca.c to document QC offload usage as you suggested.
the controller(firmware) supports both offload or non-offload, if setup SCO/eSCO by
HCI_Enhanced_Setup_Synchronous_Connection with data path parameter as 0x00, then
controller will use HCI for audio data. if as 0x01, it will use non-HCI such as PCM.

From current kernel HFP offload design,if hdev->get_data_path_id() is implemented by
device driver. it means HFP offload is ALSO SUPPORTED. whether to use offload or not is
decided by user (upper BT application) as shown below:

if user wants to use offload, then they must include offload UUID in config option KernelExperimental
within /etc/bluetooth/main.conf and use setsockopt to config BT_CODEC.

if user does not want to use offload. then they just need to remove offload UUID from option
KernelExperimental

based on above understanding, i have below points even if out of discussion scope for this change.
1) term data path selection is more suitable than offload for current design.
offload related to performing HFP coding/decoding within controller. data path selection related to
transferring audio data by HCI or non-HCI such as PCM.

2) perhaps, use setsockopt to config BT_CODEC for offload AS DEFAULT within upper application or BLUEZ,
            and just ONLY use the config option KernelExperimental to controller if to use offload.

current checking is simpler and more suitable than below 2 alternatives to prevent 
send HCI_Configure_Data_Path since they need to take this scenario as error and return error code.
even if we indeed can't take vendor special design as error wrongly.

alternative 1): check and return error code within configure_datapath_sync().
alternative 2): implement hev->get_codec_config_data by returning error code within device driver hci_qca.c
                besides, there are no suitable error code for this case.
