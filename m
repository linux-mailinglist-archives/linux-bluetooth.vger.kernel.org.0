Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Add reset hci through mgmt experimental feature

We have an annoying issue with Intel Bluetooth adapter, that is after
we update a firmware in the filessystem, and reboot the machine, the
driver will not load the new firmware since the adapter is already in
the operational mode instead of bootloader mode. we need to poweroff
the machine and cold boot it, and even on some desktops, we need to
wait for 10+ seconds between poweroff and the cold boot.

I wrote a patch for this issue last year, Marcel suggested that "we
should do it in a more generic way that resets the controller and puts
it into boot loader support if support. We can use the experimental
mgmt setting for this".

Here I wrote a new patch set according to Marcel's suggestion, a
generic reset hci method for all usb bluetooth adapters, it will reset
the adapter on the usb bus (similar to unbind the device and rebind
the device), and will call disconnect() and probe() in the btusb.c;
for Intel adapters, there is a specific method to reset the adapter
and put it into the bootloader mode.

This is the log I run reset_hci on machines with Qualcomm and CSR
adapters (generic reset hci method):
$ sudo ./btmgmt -i 0 exp-reset-hci
Reset hci feature successfully set
$ dmesg
