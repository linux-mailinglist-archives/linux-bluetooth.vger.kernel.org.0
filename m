I'm confused as to why we wouldn't just provide a mgmt interface to
enable/disable erroneous data reporting and the controller's
capability to do wideband speech separately.  Since I have most the
the code written, I'm not sure this is much about time or complexity,
but more about making sure we understand each other :)
