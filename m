Barry,

Thanks for the help. I will look into it. I fear it may be a bit 'up
hill' for me.

Can you shed any light as to why:
1) bluetoothctl does not have a command to list the currently connected devices?
2) why btmgmt cannot be run except from the command line? Not even
'btmgmt info' can be run from a script. If it runs, I cannot tell as
no output is ever generated and no error is ever listed in the
journal.

Keith
