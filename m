Hello Luiz! Headsets really do not respond to VGS and VGM command. Well
in direction from computer to headset it is not an AT command but
Unsolicited result code for which there is no reply.

So it is not possible to detect it as there is no AT command for it.

AT commands are sent in opposite direction, from headset to computer.
But in this case we want to change volume from computer to headset and
for it there is only "Unsolicited result code" which is without
response.
