I really don’t see how this is going to help. I have no interest in this. I think it is a waste of time.

That is not clearly defined. The Codec_Format is an enumeration that is used in multiple places. I think that table is missing an indication what values are valid for certain HCI commands and protocols. We did this for other assigned numbers as well.

As I said, I see zero benefit of using CVSD as input/output codec over HCI.

Read my comment again since I did check the spec. It is super unclear on what values are support for input/output codec format when using HCI transport. I bet you that once you try this, you will see limitation in the controllers and they are just telling you Invalid Parameters.

But then again, that is Transparent. So Transparent<->Transparent<->{mSBC,LC3,AuriStream,etc}.

I am not going to expose the full crazy that is that HCI command to userspace. We can support the sensible ones. If you want to toy with CVSD, alaw and ulaw, then by all means, but not in an official API.

We really need to get serious, the Bluetooth standard for SCO is over 20+ years old and eSCO has been around for almost as long. Even HFP Wideband speech has been around for many many years. There is no need for alaw and ulaw in Bluetooth. Period. And CVSD is used as legacy air codec and that is it.

Marcel
