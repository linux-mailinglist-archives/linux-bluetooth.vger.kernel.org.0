Subject: [RFC BlueZ v2] Bluetooth: Add support for Mesh Scanning and Sending
Date:   Thu, 30 Dec 2021 16:32:08 -0800
Message-Id: <20211231003208.2530079-1-brian.gix@intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.31.1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-bluetooth.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-bluetooth@vger.kernel.org

Adds four new MGMT Commands:
	- MESH_RECEIVER - Enable Mesh Receiver with Passive scanning
	  with a list of AD Types (Mesh and/or Extended Mesh).

	- MESH_FEATURES - Requests information on how many simultaneous
	  outbound  mesh packets can be pending at one time.

	- MESH_TX_PACKET - Send a requested Mesh Packet, perhaps with a
	  specific fine-timed delay.

	- MESH_TX_CANCEL - Cancel a prior Mesh TX request that has not
	  yet completed.

Adds two new MGMT Events:
	- MESH_DEVICE_FOUND - Returned when Mesh is enabled, and one of
	  the requested AD Types is detected in an incoming
	  Advertisement.

	- MESH_TX_COMPLETE - Reports that a prior requested transmission
	  has completed and no longer consumes one of the available
	  outbound slots.

+	Command Parameters:	Enable (1 Octet)
+				Window (2 Octets)
+				Period (2 Octets)
+				AD Types { variable }
+	Return Parameters:	Status
+
+	This command Enables or Disables Mesh Mode. Mesh mode, when enabled
+	keeps the controller passivly scanning for LE Advertising packets.
+	To enable Mesh, LE must first be enabled.
+
+	The Window/Period values are used to set the Scan Parameters when no
+	other scanning is being done.
+
+	The AD Types parameter, if present, will filter Advertising and Scan
+	responses by AD type. reponses that do not contain at least one of the
+	requested AD types will be discarded. Response results will be delivered
+	with the Mesh Device Found event.

+	Command Parameters:
+	Return Parameters:	Status, Used slots, Total slots
+
+	This command is used to request the count of outbound packet slots
+	which may be simultaneously requested.
+
+	Used slots (1 octet) contains the count of packets currently awaiting
+	transmission.
+
+	Total slots contains (1 octet) contains the total number of packets
+	that can be pending at one time.

+Transmit Mesh Packet Command
+==============================================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x0059
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Addr (6 octets)
+				Addr Type (1 Octets)
+				Instant (4 Octets)
+				Delay (2 Octets)
+				Count (1 Octets)
+				Data { }
+	Return Parameters:	Status, Handle
+
+	This command sends a Mesh Packet as a NONCONN LE Advertisement.
+
+	The Addr + Addr Type parameters specifify the address to use in the
+	outbound advertising packet. If BD_ADDR_ANY and LE_RANDOM is set, the
+	kernel will create a single use non-resolvable address.
+
+	The Instant parameter is used in combination with the Delay
+	parameter, to finely time the sending of the Advertising packet. It
+	should be set to the Instant value tag of a received incoming
+	Mesh Device Found Event. It is only useful in POLL-RESPONSE situations
+	where a response must be sent within a negotiated time window. The value
+	of the Instant parameter should not be interpreted by the host, and
+	only has meaning to the controller.
+
+	The Delay parameter, if 0x0000, will cause the packet to be sent
+	immediately, or at the earliest opportunity. If non-Zero, it will
+	attempt to send the packet the requested number of milliseconds after
+	the instant in time represented by the Instant parameter.
+
+	The Count parameter must be sent to a non-Zero value indicating the
+	number of times this packet will be sent before transmission completes.
+	If the Delay parameter is non-Zero, then Count must be 1 only.
+
+	The Data parameter is an octet array of the AD Type and Mesh Packet.
+
+	This command will return immediately, and if it succeeds, will generate
+	a Mesh Packet Transmission Complete event when after the packet has been
+	sent.
