While this would work with dev_flags which are internal and not API, I still donâ€™t like it.

There is really no benefit to make this a compile time option. And as far as I remember I never said this needs to be compile time. Actually I rather have this as an experimental setting so that it can be switched on at runtime. Nobody is going to recompile their kernels to test codec offload.

Regards

Marcel
