One API sure.  Maybe on multiple services.  Honestly, I don't see why 
this would be such a burden for PA to watch 2 dbus services instead of 
1.  From oFono perspective it would make more sense to keep the HSP part 
a separate daemon.  I could be convinced otherwise if it is indeed a big 
burden for PA...

Funny.  "It is used but not suitable"?

Okay.  But, just FYI, at the time there was no hw that could do such 
on-the-fly conversions, so this use case wasn't considered/implemented. 
There's really no reason why we couldn't extend our APIs to handle this.

True.  In retrospect we probably should have used strings.  But it was 
assumed that vendor extensions would go via the Bluetooth SIG Assigned 
Numbers facility.  Anyhow, we can always add a 'Register2' method that 
could take codecs as a string array or a combination of strings & ints. 
And if Register2 was used, then use 'NewConnection2' with a signature 
that supports passing in vendor codecs and whatever else that might be 
needed.

It is there on the CallVolume interface

There was no need, we automatically defaulted to using Wide band if 
available.  Third party codecs are a new use case (for oFono HFP), so 
would require an API extension.

I think all of these are feasible to support under the current oFono 
structure, either via plugins or API extensions.
