I agree it makes sense to do it on a per-client basis. What I'm not
clear on is the call process from the DBUS api down into the kernel's
`hci_req_start_scan` function I found. This is my first time
considering kernel hacking so I'm not sure of the regular process. I
imagine we'll want to turn on duplicates if any dbus client wants them
and then filter them out for any clients that don't.

Thanks,
Scott
