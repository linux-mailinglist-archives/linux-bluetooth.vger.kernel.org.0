My only concern with this command is that it seems to limit the
firmware size to 64K which perhaps is too small going forward in time
I suspect we might need 128K or even 256K if we want to be safe, so
perhaps it would be a better alternative to just have a different
location given which perhaps is even easier to parse given that by
default the drivers already load the firmware as a file so much of the
logic about uploading the firmware remains the same with the only
difference being the location. Btw, if we do change this to be file
based I guess it could be updated in the Firmware name which would
probably be great for the likes of bluetoothd so it can identify if an
alternative firmware has been loaded and skip loading it again, though
perhaps you intended the info to be used to match the loaded firmware
the problem with that is then the likes o bluetoothd will need to be
able to parse the firmware files to be able to tell if the info
matches.
