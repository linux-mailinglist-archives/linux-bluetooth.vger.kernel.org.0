Some subset of AT commands are needed to parse and interpret. But not
telephony commands and having up-to-date internal telephony state.

Yes, this would be needed, but because code os very similar it could be
reused from one common place.

Because pulseaudio has already own implementation of HSP profile and
some kind of ofono implementation (which you named below "giant hack")
it already needs to handle such problem.

But solution should be relatively simple. If we decide that new daemon
is "new proper way" then it would have higher priority as current HFP
API by ofono. So if hsphfpd is registered on dbus && hsphfpd say that it
is active, then use hsphfpd. Otherwise if ofono is registered on dbus
and say that device is active/connected use ofono.

Value is support for HSP profile and support for HFP AG role without
modem. And it would provide (for PA) unified same interface as for HFP
HF role and HFP AG role with modem. I think this is a big value for PA
(or bluez alsa or pipewire) to have one API which would handle all HSP
and HFP profile/role combinations.

I know :-) I already implemented prototype implementation to check and
see how complicated it is and if API make sense and how hard it is for
agents (audio - pulseaudio) implement and maintain it.

CSR codecs are not supported nor implemented in ofono. It is more
complicated as HFP codecs... and needs a new API for audio application.
Another value which brings my hsphfpd is that it handles these CSR
codecs and provide API for audio application to use them.

I was not thinking about certification. It is not something which I
could do.... And also pulseaudio itself do not have certifications.

Ok. I thought that phone simulator =3D ofono emulator. I just saw that
phone simulator which is described in pulseaudio documentation.

Ok, so we definitely agree that ofono currently do not support HFP AG
without modem for desktop users. And this scenario is needed for
connecting bluetooth headsets, so we need some solution for it.

Well, if this would work automatically without any user interaction or
without special setup, it seems to be usable.

But what is needed from this implementation in ofono? Basically API for
each functionality designed in hsphfod daemon. And one of it is also
support for HSP profile (with CSR and Apple extensions).

I'm not against for it, but I thought that having functionality which is
not related to telephony / modem you would not want to see in ofono
project (like linux uinput layer for button events or API for displaying
raw text on embedded display; or CSR audio codec negotiation).

So how do you see possibility to have also HSP profile in ofono? So have
one place which would provide audio API for SCO? Because this is a big
requirements from audio software side, to not use 4 different APIs to
access SCO sockets (and its rfcomm / SLC configuration) in HSP and HFP
profiles.
