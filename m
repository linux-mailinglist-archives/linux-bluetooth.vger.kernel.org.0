           Summary: Bluetooth headset auto connected but failed to
                    recognize as audio device

When i start my headset, my bluetooth headset is autoconnect to kde. 
When it finish, the device is not added to output sound device. 

When i diconnect and reconnect manualy, it works :) 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Pair a bluetooth headet and configure it as auto connect
2. Auto connect the headset.
3. If not recognized, disconect and reconnect the headset manually.

Expected Results:  

Audio device should be recognized automatically

Actual Results:  

Audio device is not recognized. But when manually connect to it, it can be
recognized as audio device by PulseAudio.

System logs:

bluetoothd[1896]: Unable to get io data for Headset Voice gateway: getpeername:
Transport endpoint is not connected (107)
dbus-daemon[953]: [system] Rejected send message, 1 matched rules;
type="method_return", sender=":1.37" (uid=1000 pid=2239
comm="/usr/bin/pulseaudio --daemonize=no ") interface="(unset)"
member="(unset)" error name="(unset)" requested_reply="0" destination=":1.11"
(uid=0 pid=1896 comm="/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd ")

I guess the cause might be: when the bluetooth signal appears, Bluez
immediately connect to it and try to exchange data with it. But the headset is
still booting and not ready for answering any request. And Bluez failed without
retrying. Maybe it should keep trying every 3 seconds, maximum 5 times (15
seconds).
