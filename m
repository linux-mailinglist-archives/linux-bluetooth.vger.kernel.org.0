Subject: [BlueZ PATCH v2] doc: Describe the new Advertisement Monitor support
Date:   Wed, 22 Apr 2020 18:09:59 -0700
Message-Id: <20200422180939.BlueZ.v2.1.If9f6be992cbaeaa35423de29da6db28675b35fcc@changeid>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.24.1

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-bluetooth-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-bluetooth.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-bluetooth@vger.kernel.org

This describes the following commands and event.
- Read Advertisement Monitor Features command
- Add Advertisement Patterns Monitor command
- Remove Advertisement Monitor command
- Advertisement Monitor Added event
- Advertisement Monitor Removed event
Note that the content of a monitor can differ based on its type. For now we
introduce only pattern-based monitor, so you may find that unlike the
command of removing monitor(s), the Add command is tied to a specific type.
---

Changes in v3:
- Remove Advertisement Monitor can perform the removal of one monitor
or all monitors.
- Add Read Advertisement Monitor Features command.
- Add Advertisement Monitor Added event and dvertisement Monitor Removed
event.

Changes in v2:
- Combine commands to remove one monitor and remove all monitors. The
refined command takes multiple handles and an extra field to indicate
whether to remove all monitors.

+Read Advertisement Monitor Features Command
+===========================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x0049
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:
+	Return Parameters:	Supported_Features (4 octets)
+				Adopted_Features (4 octets)
+
+	This command is used to read the advertisement monitor features supported
+	by the controller and stack. Supported_Features lists all related
+	features supported by the controller while Adopted_Features lists the
+	ones currently adopted by the stack.
+
+	Supported_Features and Adopted_Features are bitmasks with currently the
+	following available bits:
+
+		1	Advertisement content monitoring based on Microsoft HCI
+			extension.
+
+
+Add Advertisement Patterns Monitor Command
+=========================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x004A
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Pattern_count (1 Octets)
+				Pattern1 {
+					AD_Data_Type (1 Octet)
+					Offset (1 Octet)
+					Length (1 Octet)
+					Value (variable length)
+				}
+				Pattern2 { }
+				...
+	Return Parameters:	Monitor_Handle (4 Octets)
+
+	This command is used to add an advertisement monitor whose filtering
+	conditions are patterns. The kernel would track the number of registered
+	monitors to determine whether to perform LE scanning while there is
+	ongoing LE scanning for other intentions, such as auto-reconnection and
+	discovery session. If the controller supports advertisement filtering,
+	the kernel would offload the content filtering to the controller in
+	order to reduce power consumption; otherwise the kernel ignore the
+	content of the monitor. Note that if the there are more than one
+	patterns, OR logic would applied among patterns during filtering. In
+	other words, any advertisement matching at least one pattern in a given
+	monitor would be considered as a match.
+
+	A pattern contain the following fields.
+		AD_Data_Type	Advertising Data Type. The possible values are
+				defined in Core Specification Supplement.
+		Offset		The start index where pattern matching shall be
+				performed with in the AD data.
+		Length		The length of the pattern value in bytes.
+		Value		The value of the pattern in bytes.
+
+	Here is an example of a pattern.
+		{
+			0x16, // Service Data - 16-bit UUID
+			0x02, // Skip the UUID part.
+			0x04,

+Remove Advertisement Monitor Command
+====================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x004B
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Monitor_Handle (4 Octets)
+	Return Parameters:
+
+	This command is used to remove advertisement monitor(s). The kernel
+	would remove the monitor(s) with Monitor_Index and update the LE
+	scanning. If the controller supports advertisement filtering and the
+	monitor(s) has been offloaded, the kernel would cancel the offloading;
+	otherwise the kernel takes no further actions other than removing the
+	monitor(s) from the list.
+
+	Monitor_Handle can be the following values.
+		Value		Operation
+		-------------------------
+		0x00000000		Removes all existing monitor(s)
+		0x00000001 or greater	Removes the monitor with that handle
