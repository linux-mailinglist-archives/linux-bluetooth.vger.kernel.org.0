It's not the bluetoothd what crashes, it's the headset. My
understanding is that the headset doesn't support
ListPlayerApplicationSettingAttributes and does a poor job of handling
it. So after sending the (malformed) AVC_CTYPE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
response it reboots.

If bluetoothd doesn't expect AVC_CTYPE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, I suppose, it
should be updated to handle it. But I don't think it is going to fix
the problem of the headset rebooting. I think the fix should be to
somehow avoid sending ListPlayerApplicationSettingAttributes. Or maybe
encode it differently (e.g. by adding some parameters, if there are
any required by the spec.) Also, since I never got beyond
ListPlayerApplicationSettingAttributes, there may be more issues down
the road. I'm willing to test any patches.

Also, I filed a support request to Sennheiser regarding this issue. No
reply so far, and I don't have much hope for them solving it, but
still.
