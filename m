Hmm Im not sure if this will work since the peripheral seems to
respond different values 252 vs 247, also the spec does say that:

'The Server Rx MTU parameter shall be set to the *maximum size* of the
Attribute protocol PDU that the server can receive.
The server and client shall set ATT_MTU to the *minimum of the Client Rx MTU
and the Server Rx MTU*. The size is the same to ensure that a client can
correctly detect the final packet of a long attribute read.'

So my interpretation is that the minimum is calculated after the
Exchange is complete so it doesn't require the Server MTU to be
limited by the Client MTU, anyway if Android and iOS does apply the
minimum logic before responding we can do the same.
