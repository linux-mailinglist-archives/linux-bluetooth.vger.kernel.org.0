  shared/bap: Allow multiple links per stream

This commit adds support to link multiple streams together, creating
the foundation for implementing broadcast links: for Broadcast Sinks,
the user could select multiple streams to receive audio from. All
selected streams need to be linked together and considered when
creating BIG sync.

  shared/bap: Add support for handling broadcast links

This commit implements io handling functions as stream ops, since
broadcast links need to be handled differently than unicast:
Unicast links share the same IO, while broadcast links stand for
separate BISes with independent IOs. Unicast links have different
directions, while broadcast links share the same one.

This also adds a function for unlinking broadcast streams.

  shared/bap: Fix broadcast set state

When a stream changes state, the update is notified to other drivers
that registered a state changed callback. These callbacks might further
change the stream state, leading to the stream being freed. To avoid
use after free errors post notifications, this commit adds support to
ref/unref streams, to make sure that the stream is kept alive until all
processing is completed. This also updates the switch condition post
notifications, to handle the stream based on its current state.

  shared/bap: Use enabling state for bcast sink streams

This updates the stream state transition from CONFIG to ENABLING,
on enable for Broadcast Sink streams. This is done to differentiate
between streams discovered in the BASE after short-lived PA sync
and streams that have been selected and enabled by the user.

  bap: Add support for syncing to multiple BISes

This adds support for a Broadcast Sink to synchronize to multiple BISes
from a Source.

BISes selected by the user need to be linked together and then enabled one
by one. The first enabled stream will enqueue all its links in a request
for PA and BIG sync. After BIG sync is established, the confirm callback
will be called for each BIS io created in the kernel. Each fd will be set
inside the corresponding link, even the links that have not yet been
enabled. The enabled links will be started as soon as the fds are ready.

This adds shared/bap support for enabling and starting multiple Broadcast
Sink streams. Stream enabling should fail if any other Broadcast Sink
streams are in the process of enabling or have been enabled for the same
source. Also, a stream that has been enabled and already has the fd set
should be started on the spot.

This splits the transport set_state operation for unicast and broadcast,
by implementing it as a transport op. Unlike unicast, broadcast transports
need to be acquired/released separately, so changes in a transport state
should not affect its links.

The bluetoothctl log below shows a Broadcast Sink detecting
2 streams from a source and selecting both of them. After the
first transport is acquired, the link is created and the first
transport goes active.
