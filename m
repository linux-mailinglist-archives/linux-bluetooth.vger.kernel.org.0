Some (5, wow!) years back I've loosely proposed split for org.bluez.Device API 
that was meant to handle some of the dual mode devices issues we've been 
seeing [1] [2]. 

We never got time to fully implement it (mostly due to hacking around device.c 
instead of properly splitting internal implementation into device_le.c and 
device_bredr.c) but got some very initial PoC running.

With new interfaces old Device1 could be simply super-set of two for legacy 
applications purposes.

Maybe such approach is worth re-considering?
