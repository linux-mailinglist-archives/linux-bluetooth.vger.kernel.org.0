I didn't realize this was currently unconditional in code. In that
case, I think it's fine for you to add the flag unconditionally in
hci_h5. When we add support for wake on bt to the h5 driver, we should
make this flag conditional based on whether the driver reprobes on
resume.

I will go back and +1 the original patch.

Thanks,
Abhishek
