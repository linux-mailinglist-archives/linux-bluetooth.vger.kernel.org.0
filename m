Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Stefan, was this regression ever addressed? Doesn't look like it from
here, but maybe I'm missing something.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
