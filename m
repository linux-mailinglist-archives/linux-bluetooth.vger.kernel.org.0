I have to check with our controller folks, I do recall someone saying
that perhaps we should use framed instead of unframed so the
controller can better keep up with timings, but it is not yet clear
why.

Yeah, I don't think it is implemented yet.

Will take a look, afaik we fixed something like this not long ago but
perhaps you are talking about something different.

It used to be like that but I actually have to fix it because the
controller don't accept multiple CreateCIS in parallel:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.gi=
t/tree/net/bluetooth/hci_conn.c#n1907

And it would actually create a relatively big window if we queue and
wait for CIS established, because then the controller may set up its
scheduling without taking into account the second CIS which will then
fail when it comes to its setup, so I think it is better to program
them together to avoid having only one side working.

Btw, take a look at how it was done with bluetoothctl>
transport.acquire <transport_left> <transport_right>, we have been
able to use it to acquire both left/right earbuds and then send
pre-encoded files.
