To understand the "Connection failed to be established" disconnect
reason, let me first explain the connection process in BLE:
1. Peripheral emits ADV_IND advertising packets repeatedly with some
interval, containing its Bluetooth device address and some optional
advertising data.
2. A central device which is currently in the initiating state scans
for these advertising packets and when one is found with the correct
target address, it will reply after exactly 150 microseconds with a
CONNECT_IND packet.
3. The central is now in the "connected" state and this fact is sent
to the host using a "LE Connection Complete Event".
4. At the peripheral side, the "connected" state is entered when it
receives the CONNECT_IND packet.

In the connected state, the central emits one packet (possibly empty)
once per connection interval and the peripheral must respond within
150 microseconds. If there is no response for the first six packets in
a connection, the central will treat the connection disconnected with
the reason "Connection failed to be established". If the peripheral
responds at least once, but after that at any time it doesn't respond
to a central's packet within the set supervision timeout, the
"Connection Timeout" disconnect reason will happen.

We can derive a few reasons why "Connection failed to be established" occur=
s:

1. If the CONNECT_IND packet is lost in the air, the peripheral does
not enter the connected state, but the central does. In this case the
peripheral will not respond to any other packet the central sends,
since the peripheral is not in the connected state.
2. The peripheral could use white listing to allow connections from
only specific centrals. In this case the central will always see a
connection complete immediately followed by a connection failed to be
established.
3. Bad signal quality could mean the peripheral detects the
CONNECT_IND but not any of the first six packets sent by the central.
4. A bad link layer scheduler in any of the two bluetooth controllers
could skip the first six connection events.

With the new extended advertising packet format introduced in
Bluetooth 5.0 that not many devices use, an extra acknowledgement is
sent from the peripheral after it receives the CONNECT_IND to mitigate
this confusion a bit.

Common reasons for the Connection Timeout are bad signal quality or a
bad link layer scheduler, or possibly too much overlapping work
scheduled for the radio.

Anyway, nothing is wrong at the host side (BlueZ) for these problems.
It just happened that the MTU Request and Attribute Not Found packets
were the last ones before the disconnection occurred. You should use
an air sniffer for BLE to maybe get some more insight.
