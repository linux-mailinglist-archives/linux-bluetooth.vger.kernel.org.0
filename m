discovery_filter_to_mgmt_cp() does not add discovery_filter.discoverable
to the created mgmt_cp_start_service_discovery struct.

Instead update_discovery_filter() separately checks
client->discovery_filter->discoverable for all clients.

This means that for discovery-filters which only have the discoverable
flag set, to put the adapter in discoverable mode while discovering,
the created mgmt_cp_start_service_discovery struct is empty.

This empty mgmt_cp_start_service_discovery struct then gets sent
to the kernel as part of a MGMT_OP_START_SERVICE_DISCOVERY msg
by start_discovery_timeout().

This use of an empty filter with MGMT_OP_START_SERVICE_DISCOVERY
causes some bluetooth devices to not get seen with some (most?)
Broadcom bluetooth adapters. This problem has been observed with
the following Broadcom models: BCM4343A0, BCM43430A1, BCM43341B0 .

On these models the following 2 devices were not being discovered
when starting a scan with a filter with just discoverable set
in the filter (as gnome-bluetooth does):

Since setting the discoverable flag on a filter only is a way to
automatically put the adapter in discoverable mode itself while
it is discovering; and since this does not any device filtering
at all; modify merge_discovery_filters() to treat discovery with
such filters as regular unfiltered discovery.

This results in start_discovery_timeout() starting regular
discovery through a MGMT_OP_START_DISCOVERY message and this
fixes these 2 example devices not getting discovered by the
mentioned Broadcom BT adapter models.

Note the same argument can be made for the pattern and duplicate part of
the filters which also get handled outside of the kernel filter.
But I prefer to keep the first patch small and targetted at solving things
not working with the gnome-bluetooth filter settings.

Also I'm not familiar enough with the code to say with certainty that
filters with just a pattern or the duplicate flag set (or a combination)
should also be treated as unfiltered discovery.

Changes in v2:
- Fix a couple of typos / grammar errors in the commit message
- Replace hard-tabs in commit message with spaces
- Add Bastien's Reviewed-by tag
