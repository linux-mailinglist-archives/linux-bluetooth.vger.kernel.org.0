I'm not sure since I don't have access to the 1.3 spec and haven't found
it online in a quick search.  This however makes the most sense since
feature category 2 seems to _only_ concern itself with volume-related
functionality, which are merely SetAbsoluteVolume and
EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED and introduced only since 1.4.

I wonder if there's anything specific besides the class indicating a
phone factor and the appearance of an avrcp controller with v1.3 but
this feature bit set.

I'll send a followup in two stages: one that introduces a
FEATURE_CATEGORY_2 check around all volume handling, and another that
bumps the requirement for the peer-controller down to v1.3 with clear
comments about AOSP - unless you have better ideas to detect it :)

Anything on this commit?  I'd like to improve the FEATURE_CATEGORY_2
checks and this is quite alarming and conflicting with that.
