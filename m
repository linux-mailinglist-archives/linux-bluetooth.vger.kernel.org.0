Hi Rafael,

I left a comment on the bugzilla post as well but I agree with you now
that it's probably bad to fail suspend when this occurs.

At https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git/tree/net/bluetooth/hci_core.c#n3363,
we try to recover from a failed suspend by restoring running state and
returning an -EBUSY.
I think if we change this logic to not attempt to restore until
resume, log the error and allow suspend, that would probably be
preferable from a suspend perspective.
I will make this change, test it out and send the patch today.

Thanks
Abhishek
