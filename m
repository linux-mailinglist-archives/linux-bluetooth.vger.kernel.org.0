right, I was thinking this is filename used in the request_firmware(). However now I remember that we talked about passing the actual blob via mgmt for development purposes. Now doing an actual blob loading larger then around 63k is impossible with mgmt since our frame size field is only 16-bit.

Seems like I have to go back to thinking board.

Marcel
