I don’t remember anymore. I must have made sense for hci_req_run at some point, but right now I fail to connect the dots. For all complicated tasks we spawn into a work queue anyway.

The hci_req_run is something I can see kinda making sense since you have a real callback for the result. The hci_req_sync just puts the HCI command collection into a function, but both will wait. The hci_cmd_sync is essentially a hci_req_sync with a single command. So just a helper around it.

That difference is beyond me actually. I think that hci_req_sync usage should be just replaced.

Even the sync version is utilizing hci_req_run in the background.

The problem with hci_req_run is that there is no rollback possible since you really don’t know where it stopped. This made all sense if you have to send two commands to get something started, but if you send more than 2 than it becomes undeterministic.
