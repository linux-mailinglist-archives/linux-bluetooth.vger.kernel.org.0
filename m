But in this case we put these default remote features to HFP DBus agent
like if they were specified in SDP. Default value is specific for
profile version. And if e.g. new HFP version defines a new bit in
features with its own default value then HFP DBus agent would not be
able to distinguish between state when remote device did not specified
any value (as bluez will put there some defaults) and when remote device
specified same features as bluez has defined in its current default
value.

Before and also after this change remote features are not send to HFP
DBus agent when they were not specified by remote device.

After your suggestion HFP DBus agent would not be able to check if
remote device provided features or not. And this is I think a
regression.
