can we get a mgmt-tester test case for this that also checks the various combinations of this.

And coming to think about it, should we mark controllers as “good” if they allow create connection and inquiry at the same time? So we do this conditionally based on what controller we have.

Eventually we have to get to the level to create a proper state machine for BR/EDR and LE so that we serialize all of these commands accordingly. That way we can easily continue where we left off. This should also come in handy for any kind of suspend / resume handling. Since at the end of the day it is all the same problem. We need to pause some radio activity and continue afterwards.

In case this wasn’t clear, I am not in favor of just sending a command and hope for the best. That got us in trouble with BlueZ 3.x and to large extend also with BlueZ 4.x since weird corner cases will bring us out of sync.

Regards

Marcel
