but I am not adding a new kernel-userspace API so that you can tinker with it only to realize that we then get an unneeded API that I have to support for years to come.

If you want this then do it with your own kernel patches and provide numbers that would show this works and improves certain devices. Unless I see that, I am sticking with my point of view.

I am not blocking you writing kernel patches. I am just not putting them upstream just for sake of it.

This argument is mood. They are not used as air codecs with Bluetooth. If you don’t use Wideband speech, it will be CVSD as air codec and nothing else.

We can design something to allow tuning transparent setup, but if you want to play with CVSD as host codec, then you are on your own.
