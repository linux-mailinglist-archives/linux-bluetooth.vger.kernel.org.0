I have nothing in common with maintaining bluetooth stack in the kernel, but
I'd like to comment on this a bit.
That patch adds a device ID to the list of "Fake CSR devices with broken
commands".
And you write that it is a "workaround" of this bug, not a "fix".
If I were a maintainer of BT stack in the kernel, I would try to avoid merging
such patches unless I have this piece of hardware and a datasheet.
So, here, I would not blame kernel maintainers for ignoring such bugs.

Maybe I misunderstood something, feel free to correct me.

Actually I did not understand from this bug report if this patch works or not.
Does btusb-Enablement-of-HCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_STORED_LINK_KEY-quirk.patch make
device just detectable or actually working?
