The same thing can be said about CreateNetwork() call - you don't really 
*need* to have an attached (of even "attachable") application in order 
to create a new node.

In fact, CreateNetwork() and ImportLocalNode() calls are very similar in 
this regard, it's just that CreateNetwork generates keys, addresses and 
starting sequence number on the daemon side, while ImportLocalNode() 
allows passing them from the application.

Since CreateNetwork() does query the app via D-Bus, I think it's more 
consistent to query the app during ImportLocalNode() as well.

That, or replace both calls with a more generic CreateNode() call that 
would accept create/import data as an agument, and not query the app at 
all.

This is covered by the same code path as other calls. I think it's 
cleaner to always perform GetManagedObjects() dance for all 4 calls.

And, as I mentioned before, this code path becomes even simpler when we 
refactor "sanity checking" to compare serialized composition data.

Not necessarily. The application needs to provide ProvisionAgent 
interface only, and only in cases where provisioner selects 
authentication method that requires the app to perform some OOB action.

It is entirely possible for a joining node to say it doesn't support any 
OOB actions, and the mesh daemon can accept provisioning wihout any 
interaction with the app.

I don't think it makes sense to have a utility application that would 
migrate the node without having anything that would Attach() to it.

IMO the migration operation should be a part of application logic, 
because this operation requires talking to external Provisioner, and 
Provisioner API is vendor specific. So I don't think you can't really 
create a 'generic migration tool'.

In case of replaced device, the use case I see is re-installing the same 
application on a new device, and having it re-create the node either 
from data received from the Provisioner, or exported from the previous 
instance of the application. I don't see a need to instantiate the node 
on the replaces device without reinstalling the application - such a 
node would not be operational anyway.
