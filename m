Ok, so it misbehaves with the Windows drivers too once a USB-2 hub (with its
TT) gets into play. So other then only using the dongle directly plugged in=
to
really old (by now) motherboars there really is not much which you can do h=
ere
I'm afraid.

I suggest you buy a new dongle. If you search on say aliexpress (*) for csr=
8510
then you will find several dongles which are advertised as "original csr8510
chip" in my experience these indeed contain a real CSR8510 chip and they wo=
rk a
lot better then the clones. So the best advice which I have is just to order
one of those.

This advice goes for everyone in this thread who is still having issues. Tr=
ying
to get these clone to work with Linux is a good thing to do, since this will
also help other users with such clones. But if you just want something which
works then just buying a dongle with a real CSR8510 chip is the way to go
(these things are pretty affordable).
