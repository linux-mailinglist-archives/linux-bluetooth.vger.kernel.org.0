No HCI command fails, there is also no issue reported in the kernel log.
BlueZ just stops receiving BLE packets, at least from certain devices.

After review the code I concluded the same. What is a bit surprising to
me is that it is so well reproducible. I guess it is nicer to have a
reproducible one than a hard to reproduce one :)

I've taken two btmon captures, I created them using:
btmon -i hci0 -w /config/hcidump-hci-req-working.log

You can find them at:
https://os-builds.home-assistant.io/hcidump-hci-req-working.log
https://os-builds.home-assistant.io/hcidump-hci-sync-non-working.log

This is while running our user space software (Home Assistant with
Bluetooth integration). Besides some BLE devices (e.g. Xioami Mi
Temperature & Humidity sensor) I have a ESP32 running which sends SPAM
advertisements every 100ms (this accelerates the issue). In the
non-working case you'll see that the system doesn't receive any SPAM
advertisements after around 27 seconds. The working log shows that it
continuously receives the same packets (capture 120s).

Hope this helps.
