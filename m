 currently enabled on the controller.

> +Set/Get pattern filter
> +Discover devices where the pattern matches either the prefix of the addr=
ess or the device name, which is a convenient way to limit the number of de=
vice objects created during a discovery.
> +When set, it disregards device discoverable flags.
> +Note: The pattern matching is ignored if there are other clients that do=
n't set any pattern, as it works as a logical OR. Also, setting an empty st=

 firmware will be reloaded at this time.

> +advertise
> +---------
> +Enable/disable advertising with given type
> +Will start advertising. If you exit the program advertising will be disa=
bled. When advertising the controller should advertise with random address =
but may use its public address if it does not support the feature (address =
of the device)
> +A device can advertise if it initiated the connection to another adverti=
sing device.
> +When advertising the controller will always advertise with the connectab=
le option.

> +
> +scan
> +----
> +Scan for devices
> +  For LE, scanning is an important requirement before connecting or pair=
ing. The purpose of scanning is to find devices
> +  that are advertising with their discoverable flag set (either limited =
or general). Once you have found the address
> +  then you can connect or pair. Note the following when scanning:
> +
> +  - When scanning the controller will use a random address that is not r=
esolvable. A new random address is created every time scan on is used.
> +  - When turning on scanning the device will start receiving advertising=
 reports of what devices are advertising.
> +  - The filtering of duplicate advertising reports is enabled.
> +  - The scan interval and scan window are fixed at 11.250 msec.
> +  - You do get advertising reports from nondiscoverable devices.
> +  - Scan reports have a finite time duration and will expire. If they ex=
pire you will need to scan again before connecting or pairing.
> +
> +:Usage: **# scan <on/off/bredr/le>**
> +
> +pair
> +----
> +Pair with device
> +This will pair with a device and then trust and connect to it. If the de=
vice is already paired this will first remove the pairing.
> +Pairing provides authentication or encryption. The command can either be=
 used while the controller is in the connected or not connected state.
> +If the controller is already connected then the pair command can be used=
 without an arguments. If the controller is not connected, the pair
> +command can be given the address of a device with an active scan report =
and it will initiate the connection before pairing.
> +Before pairing the agent must be selected to choose the authentication m=
echanism.
> +
> +:Usage: **# pair <dev>**
> +
> +pairable
> +--------
> +Set controller pairable mode
> +This enables/disables pairing. If pairing is disabled then the controlle=
r will not accept any pairing requests.
> +
> +:Usage: **# pairable <on/off>**
> +
> +discoverable
> +------------
> +Set discoverable mode
> +This enables/disables discoverable mode. If discoverable is disabled the=
n the controller will not respond to any scan requests.
> +In LE if discoverable if off the controller will just passively scan and=
 not make scan requests to advertising devices. If on it will make the adve=
rtising requests.
> +It will use a random address if supported by the controller. The length =
of time "discoverable on" is valid is determined by discoverable-timeout
> +
> +:Usage: **# discoverable <on/off>**
> +
> +discoverable-timeout

> +
> +agent
> +-----
> +Enable/disable agent with given capability
> +This chooses the local authentication mechanism of the controller. It is=
 needed for pairing and allows you to choose the IO capabilities of the con=
troller.

play, KeyboardOnly, NoInputNoOutput.

> +connect
> +-------
> +Connect device
> +This will initiate a connection to a device. If the device is not paired=
 this will first pair and then trust and connect to it.
> +To connect with a device the controller must have an active scan report =
of the device it wants to connect to. The advertising report can be obtaine=
d either by using the scan command
> +otherwise the connect command will issue a HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Scan_Enab=
le to find the device. If no advertising report is received before the time=
out a le-connection-abort-by-local
> +error will be issued. In that case either try again to connect assuming =
the device is advertising.
