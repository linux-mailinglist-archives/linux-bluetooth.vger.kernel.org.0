Subject: Re: UUIDs for every single physical peripheral's service and characteristics?

So let me make sure I understand. The devices themselves have their
own Bluetooth addresses (similar to MAC addresses, I don't know the
proper term) which are unique among every physical device sold. And
also there is one (and only one) service UUID which is shared among
all 1,000+ peripherals which I sell, and 19 characteristic UUIDs that
are shared among the physical peripherals. The devices come with their
own Bluetooth "MAC" and I only need to obtain 20 UUIDs in total for
the product line. Did I get that right?

Would you consider yourself a good person? Have you ever taken the
'Good Person' test? It's a fascinating five minute quiz. Google it.
