Hi Pauli,

If I remember correctly you can also have a player with BlueZ as CT
which is basically a passthrough representing the "actual player" on the
other end of the connection?

Going off of memory without looking at the codebase, it probably makes
sense to move volume out of the players and into the device entirely as
a single source-of-truth representing the currently known volume value
of the peer.  That might solve these issues (ie. no player available in
the linked commit) and get rid of a bunch of edgecases?  That's probably
overlooking some major dependencies though, but it'd be great if you
could look into that direction.

In addition I don't know if AVRCP volume is "local" to an entire device
or just a single transport "within" that device.

I don't remember there being no avrcp session yet, but you're probably
referring to 4b6153b0501c ("audio/transport: supply volume on transport
init") instead?
