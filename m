We could in possibly add pid/vid to btd_profile that way it can be
probed by pid/vid in addition to UUID, that way one can make a driver
that is specific to a vendor or a product.

I would recommend hooking to the btd_service state, like for example
the policy plugin is doing.

We had some discussion on weather we should continue using a custom
D-Bus interface or just emulate the battery reports over UHID given
that is probably better integrated with the system.

I'd probably add Bose to the name of the interface if it is bose specific.
