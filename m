I quite like this proposal. Avoiding the need to implement the button
press, battery level etc. handling separately in PulseAudio, oFono and
PipeWire seems like a pretty good justification to me. I assume you're
volunteering to maintain this new daemon?

It's not clear to me how this would affect the PulseAudio <-> oFono
interaction, if at all. When oFono is used, would PulseAudio get the
audio socket from oFono or hsphfpd? What about volume commands, would
they go through oFono or would PulseAudio interact with hsphfpd
directly?

I think hsphfpd should be part of bluetoothd, but if that's not
possible, then that's not possible.

(I don't want to get into a lengthy discussion about programming
languages, but I'll just note here that I don't like Perl.)
