Hi Luiz,

Thanks for looking at this. I did see the main.conf file, and the
documentation is fairly clear, but I think there is still a bug here.
Mainly: if one enables the experiment via main.conf, but the driver
for the kernel has not set the relevant quirk indicating that the
device supports the functionality, we are still seeing
"central-peripheral" listed as supported. Ultimately this leads to
test failures for us as, believing that the functionality is
supported, we execute tests that then fail (this is reproducible if
you modify a test device's driver to not support this feature (for
btusb I removed BTUSB_VALID_LE_STATES as an attribute) and enable the
feature via main.conf). In code, I think the culprit is seen in this
function in that the value of "action" is set exclusively by the
main.conf file, and is then passed into "feat->func" which adds it to
"adapter->exps" (at least for this feature). Given what you've said
here, I believe the right solution would be to require that both the
feature be supported (as derived from the driver) and enabled (as
derived from main.conf) in order to consider the feature enabled (as
reported to peers/via query).
