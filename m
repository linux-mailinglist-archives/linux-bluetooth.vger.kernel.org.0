Luiz, Marcel, thx for fixing this 5.16 regression and picking the patch
up for merging. But I have to wonder: why was this simple fix put into a
tree that apparently is meant to only get merged to mainline during the
the next merge window? That will mean this regression will bother people
(maybe Paul is not the only one that is affected by this) for weeks to
come and even make it into 5.17, before it gets fixed for 5.18-rc1.
Despite the lack of a "Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>" tag it likely will
get backporting to 5.17.y and 5.16.y afterwards, but the latter soon
after will be EOLed anyway.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but that afaik is not how the Linux development
process is meant to handle such regressions. This approach also
contributes to the huge stable and longterm releases after the end of
each merge window, which some people see as a problem.

I bring this up because there were other regression fixes in the last
few weeks that took such a slow path towards mainline. I also checked
MAINTAINERS and noticed you even have a tree that could feed fixes like
this to Linus via the regular net tree, but apparently you haven't used
it in quite a while:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth.git
I rechecked and noticed not a single bluetooth fix was merged between
v5.16-rc1..v5.16. I doubt Jakub or Dave are the reason, as they merge
fixes from downstream trees every week and send them to Linus shortly
after that.

So why are things like that? Or is there something wrong with my look on
things?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
