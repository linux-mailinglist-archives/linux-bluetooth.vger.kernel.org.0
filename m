You should have mentioned that you are using 5.48, you need the following p=

commit a0b886e26c83ad4dfbf0b2b2e024c8ce9ead9a7d

    gatt: Add support for storing Service Changed CCC value

    This adds support for storing CCC value of Service Changed
    characteristic. Once bluetoothd is restart stored values are read
    and any device subscribed to indications will receive Service Changed
    indication with 0x00010-0xffff value. This is to invalidate any
    non-core services since there is no way to verify if applications
    will register their services in same order (or at all).

    This fix accessing invalid handles by stacks that rely only on Service
    Changed indication for rediscovery ie. Apple iOS.

Or upgrade to a BlueZ release that has the above patch, which should be 5.5=
0:

+ver 5.50:
+       Fix issue with GATT and reading long values.
+       Fix issue with GATT and reading multiple includes.
+       Fix issue with GATT and service changes when offline.
+       Fix issue with handling secondary service discovery.
+       Fix issue with handling persistency of CCC values.

You don't need to register Service Changed, the daemon already takes
care of registering it and there could only be one Service Changed in
the database.

 when we upgrade the build from 100 to 101, the app gets the wrong data. We=
 looked at the log. When the app tries to read temperature by using the tem=
perature UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received the reques=
t to read the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device name" is retu=
rned to the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavior as th=
e bluetooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/bluetooth/[BT_=
MAC]/cache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files in the =
folder. That means the disabled cache seems working.
