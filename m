Right, so I assume then every application interested on battery would
then attempt to subscribe for the battery level on the own instead of
using org.bluez.Battery1? Either way that would be done via D-Bus but
dealing with a characteristic seem quite a bit more expensive not to
mention is another object the daemon has to maintain.

There are runtime switches to disable plugins i.e.: bluetoothd -P
battery and we can add build time switches as well, btw patches are
welcome if you want to disable battery plugin.

If the system don't have any need for battery it can disable it just
like I said, but depending on the system it is probably better to
leave the daemon to subscribe since there could be several
applications interested on the battery status, simply reading
org.bluez.Battery1 is a _lot_ simpler than enumerating all attributes
and then subscribing to one characteristic.

There should be but it up for the system to decide if it wants a
dedicated plugin to deal with the battery status or not, for the
desktop usecase it is most likely simpler to support.
