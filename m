398de is the one where the leaks stop being reproducable by the method we u=
se. At first sight the changes you made seem unrelated to the memleak, so t=
he main question for us is now: has the resolution been accidental or inten=

So it is not reproducible anymore?

Well I suppose it is due to the cleanup process freeing l2cap_conn in
the process, while perhaps the previous code didn't.
