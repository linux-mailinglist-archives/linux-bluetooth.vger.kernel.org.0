I just posted an RFC set:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/bluetooth/list/?series=3D726293

Make sure you also have the set bellow, apparently this was the cause
of transport not showing up since bap_ready callback was called to
early before we had subscribed for notifications, etc:

Yeah, Im afraid the headset might be trying to minimize using a jitter
buffer so if we miss any internal it will cause such problem, the
other problem is that the controller may not be reporting the Number
of Packets Complete one by one, which cause us to send packets in
batches which end up removing the timing accuracy of the socket since
we have to wait the controller to acknowledge the packets previously
sent, perhaps we could try detecting this behavior and disable Number
of Packets Complete flow control, so we send based on the configured
interval no matter if we think there is a buffer available in the
controller or not.
