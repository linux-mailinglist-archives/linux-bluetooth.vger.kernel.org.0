I don't remember the exact details.  I seem to remember that for mSBC 
the conversion was being done on the host and no 'on-the-fly' conversion 
was done in hardware.  Thus this host codec negotiation was not needed / 
considered.

So you might want to get BlueZ guys to expose this info properly first. 
oFono is not in the business of opening raw hci sockets.

Only PA (or whatever implements the audio agent) really cares about this 
info and it can obtain it via getsockopt.  So I really don't see why the 
MTU should be exposed via D-Bus.  And this is why it wasn't.  I don't 
see an issue here...?

So in my opinion it is really up to the kernel to tell us whether a 
given hardware supports wideband speech.  So any quirks need to go into 
the kernel.  Then userspace can select the best available codec 
automatically without resorting to having the user twiddle some settings.

Your initial proposal wanted to use oFono as some sort of helper for 
your daemon, and that is just not going to be accepted by oFono 
upstream.  I gave you a few alternatives, including how to extend oFono 
to do what you want.  If you want to roll your own, go for it.
