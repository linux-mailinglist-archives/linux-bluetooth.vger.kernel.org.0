Running with 5.17.0-0.rc5.102.fc37.x86_64 there doesn't seem to be any
problems, well apart from LE device with Privacy/RPA:

https://gist.github.com/Vudentz/5792f4989198c7f2994af2e31eb973af

Ive tried suspend/resume a couple of times just to see if there is
something odd going own, anyway I'm running with the latest userspace
so perhaps I really need some old userspace to reproduce this. There
might be something with name resolving though, it appears gnome don't
show devices if they don't have a proper name (that is not their
address) so perhaps that gives the impression there is nothing going
on when in fact that all normal, well apart from the fact that names
takes way too long to be resolved.
