Hi,

Yes I did consider that, but there still is an issue sometimes on
resume too and the BT_SUSPEND_DISCONNECT handling takes 200 ms which
is nice to get rid of too. So I opted to just disable the
hci_suspend_notifier().

The RTL8723bs is the cheapest of cheap wifi/bt combo chip and is
often found on cheap/slow devices. I did see this:

[  598.686060] Bluetooth: hci0: Timed out waiting for suspend events
[  598.686124] Bluetooth: hci0: Suspend timeout bit: 5
[  598.686237] Bluetooth: hci0: Suspend notifier action (4) failed: -110

At least once, it might just be that the 2 seconds elapsed before
the reprobe ran (or there might still be a race somewhere).

Ok, I did consider using a quirk for this myself, but I was not sure
if this warranted a core change since this is a somewhat unique
situation.

I'll respin the patch into a patch-set adding a quirk, thank you
for your feedback.

Regards,

Hans
