Is there a way that we could have some persistent storage for when the
last authentication error happened?

This would allow showing a /!\ icon in the device list even though we
don't have an agent running in the session, just when the settings are
open, in GNOME.

This would also allow the settings to get this information in the first
place, otherwise we'd need to have some side-channel to funnel that
information from the "desktop-wide" agent to the settings agent.

I've made the upstream bug[1] public now, can you reference it in the
commit message?

Cheers
