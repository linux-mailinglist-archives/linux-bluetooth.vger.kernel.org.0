Not following you on this one, oFono is intended for telephony
functionality and afaik it could parse battery, etc. Also would your
daemon include such functionality or you are to combine that with
oFono? I do appreciate the effort you have put into the SBC modes and
codec support but Im afraid you are going to experience some real pain
to maintain such a system all in your own, there are a lot of features
being exposed via AT commands and we risk to have yet another daemon
that just do parts of them until the next person comes with a
different use case and we are back to square one.

Well the exactly the same thing with yet another daemon, we obviously
will need an AT parser, but the nice thing of being a native plugin is
that it can detect if another entity register for HSP/HFP and disable
itself (or have a policy to control that), the implementation can be
exactly what you have but without the extra rounds trips involved to
communicate back and forth with your daemon, so it is pretty straight
forward in terms o implementation.
