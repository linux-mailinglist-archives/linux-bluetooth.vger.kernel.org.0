The profile itself has no interest in how the platform is built. What you are going to do is configure possible PCM data path options and then the kernel will use that information for Enhanced Sync Setup. However the profile should only provide the over-the-air settings since that is what is going to be negotiated during the profile setup.

Only because HCI has a single command for things, doesn’t mean we are stuffing all of the information via a single ioctl and then let userspace deal with the mess. That is not how we designed things.

Hello! This is a friendly reminder that another month passed and this
issue is still open.

Now it is more then 9 months since I reported this problem that kernel
does not allow to setup SCO transport for AuriStream codec and I really
would like to move forward.

Could somebody help me what could I do to move forward and unblock
kernel to allow usage of additional SCO codecs and also to allow usage
of hardware mSBC encoder/decoder?

I'm starting to feel frustrated as it looks like it is ignored and I do
not see any way how can I continue and solve this problem.

In userspace I cannot do anything if kernel forbids to setup SCO
connection with custom parameters which are needed for other codecs.
Also I cannot do anything in userspace if kernel does not allow to use
in-hardware mSBC encoder/decoder, I cannot activate it from userspace.
