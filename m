Right looks like Privacy Mode was introduced in 5.0 but LL Privacy was
already part of 4.2, so I guess we will need to check if the command
is really supported after all.

Yep, I actually realized that the reason we have limited privacy as a
mode for LE is that on dual-mode while discoverable it would already
blast the address over BR/EDR, so we might as well only allow the use
of limited-* modes on dual mode.
