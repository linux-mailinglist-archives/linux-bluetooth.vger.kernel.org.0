The sequence of events is important here. The
session->supported_events must be initialised (which is done in
target_init) before first AVRCP_REGISTER_NOTIFICATION command from the
remote side controller. If supported_events is not initialised and
AVRCP_REGISTER_NOTIFICATION arrives the
avrcp_handle_register_notification function rejects the event
registration. And this is what I see in wireshark.
And in my case, calling target_init earlier (the is before
controller_init) solves the problem because supported_events is
already initialised at the time the AVRCP_REGISTER_NOTIFICATION
arrives.
But I think that the problem is more general. There is some gap
between AVCTP connection establishment and BlueZ readiness to handle
commands from the remote side. There could be devices that send
commands during this gap and those devices would not work correctly
with BlueZ despite the fact that they are consistent with the
specification (or not ?).

I don't know if I'm interpreting your words correctly but I think that
You make an assumption that a2dp sink must be avrcp CT and a2dp source
is avrcp TG.
In case of the absolute volume control it is not true. For absolute
volume control to work it is the other way around which makes both
sides be CT and TG at the same time. a2dp sink is avrcp CT for
controlling playback and a2dp source is avrcp CT for setting the
volume. It is the a2dp source that is sending
AVRCP_SET_ABSOLUTE_VOLUME commands.
