#regzbot fixed-by: a9a347655d224fa284187

That fix landed in bluetooth-next. I wonder if that fix would better
have been merged in this cycle, as that will mean many users are exposed
to this for at least three more weeks, but whatever.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
