actually the kernel doesnâ€™t know either. We start with an allowed packet type mask and then the LC on each side will negotiate the current used packet types. These can change at any time. So if you want to know the current packet type, we would have to poll for it, but there is also no command that can do that.

The only thing that could be done is to limit the allowed packet types when creating the connection. However that again defeats the purpose since A2DP is not the only user of that ACL link.

What might be useful is to start using the flow specification and configure it on an ACL if an L2CAP socket for audio has been created.

Marcel
