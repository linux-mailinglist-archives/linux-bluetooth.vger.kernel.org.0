I applied your patch and tested a number of scenarios. Here are the 
results. Apologies for any bad line wraps. I guess I haven't managed to 
tame Thunderbird yet:

warm boot:
   unpatched kernel to patched kernel : doesn't work
   patched kernel to patched kernel   : works

patched kernel tests:
   starting from cold boot:
     works
   disable/re-enable bt by plasma UI:
     works
   restart bluetooth service:
     works
   unload/re-load hci_uart and bluetooth service:
     doesn't work after reload; can't enable BT
     I think this worked with Zijun's commit, but I'm not 100% sure.
   disable bluetooth service, warm boot, start bluetooth service:
     fails to connect to devices

What follows are logs for the non-working cases that only involve the 
patched kernel:

logs for unload/re-load hci_uart and bluetooth service test when 
reloading the module:

So, I noticed that your patch doesn't include the quirk conditional from 
Zijun's commit. I am assuming that that was intentional. However, I 
wanted to point it out in case that was somehow material to the results.

Please let me know what else I can do to help. And again, I really 
appreciate your effort on this.
