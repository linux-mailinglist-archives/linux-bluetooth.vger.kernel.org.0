Hi Matias,

Thanks for your answer.

Yes, I am testing on rooted device with LineageOS ROM (without patch).
I think LOS devices generally didn't get the patch yet (wasn't patched
in the Repo as as checked it out few days ago), unfortunately ...

I guess many devices will never get the fix, unless you take it in
your own hands with custom Rom etc.

Good BT has to be on, you need to be in the proximity and BT ADDR has
to be known, I can imagine for real attacks you need to know the ROP
chains (function addresses on the device, which will vary from device
to device and builds), maybe chain attacks, use other tricks, also
Samsung Devices have KNOX/RKP etc. Recently read that Android
vulnerabilities are in high demand, higher than Apple phones, since
Android improved a lot in security. I think this will not be too easy
in practical life, but I might be wrong.

Above can be wrong :)

I am looking into this for fun and to learn new things about Android.

For me enough would be to crash the BT process.

Could be there is much to todo, many hops to jump through, asking in
this group to see, if maybe I am missing something obvious.

BT self learner. I am surely missing core knowledge about it (learnt
many thing in past 24 hrs), hence my email to this group. From briefly
looking into this, could not figure out how this:

https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/+/3cb7149d8fed2d7d77ceaa95bf845224c4db3baf/hci/src/packet_fragmenter.cc#220

can happen, especially based on my simple tests? As I wrote in my
previous email.

Any insights, guidance will be greatly appreciated.


Thanks,
