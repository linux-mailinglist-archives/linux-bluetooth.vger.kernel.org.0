Yeah, we should probably integrate all the roles into mesh, now about
mesh-cfgclient I wonder if we wouldn't be better off integrating it
into bluetoothctl directly though, so one can control all daemon with
that instead of resorting to different clients.

Yeah, that is intentional so we don't have to replicate the GATT and
LE advertisement handling on meshd.
