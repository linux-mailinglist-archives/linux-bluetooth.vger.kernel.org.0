This isn't quite how the pattern is usually used. With the existing
patterns, the OS-supplied stock configuration would be in
/usr/lib/bluetooth/main.conf.d (maybe with the default .conf in the
same directory as that subdir), with /etc/bluetooth/main.conf.d only
used for the user/admin override the default configuration.

I don't think that making it optional, or have the path changeable is
needed, but the rest seems good.

Cheers
