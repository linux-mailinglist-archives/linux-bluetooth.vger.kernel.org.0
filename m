Hi Luiz,

I guess you are hoping for PEBKAC :-)

Until I got your patch yesterday, I was using a clone of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git which I update frequently and have been doing so for as
long as I can remember. Just in case there was a hidden flaw in that tree, I took a new clone yesterday, (so yes, the
patch was tested on top of rc6) copied over the .config file and applied the patch. Then I built and installed the
kernel, updated grub, powered off the laptop and booted into the new kernel. Once the laptop had booted and logged in to
my LXQt desktop, I powered on my headphones and a connection was establisehed almost straight away. I powered the
headphones off and the disconnection worked fine.

Knowing that the problem crops up intermittently, I then rebooted the laptop. When the boot was complete, I then powered
on my bluetooth headphones an waited for them to connect to the laptop. After about 20 seconds, a connection had not
been established. I powered off the headphones, used modprobe to unload and then reload the btusb module. When I powered
on the headphones, a connectiin was established within 2 or 3 seconds.

I've booted this laptop countless times over the last few days. Doing the bisect, I didn't mark a commit as good until I
had done five boots and been able to connect my headphones on each boot. What I can say from that work is that two
consecutive boots into a working kernel are very rare. I can't remeber an occasion when it took more than two boots to
establish that a kernel was bad.
