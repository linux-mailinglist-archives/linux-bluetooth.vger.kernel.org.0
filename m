Android 11 on Samsung Galaxy S10 with current software.

The problem is not the Android, but the device I am trying to pair with 
(VOX Adio Air GT guitar amplifier). The Bluetooth implementation in the 
device is most probably outdated or/and broken and definitely insecure, 
but I still need to connect to it. Android can do that, I wonder how I 
can do it from a regular Linux machine with recent kernel and Bluez.
