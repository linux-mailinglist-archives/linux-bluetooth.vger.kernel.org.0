Yes, I noticed after hitting *Send*.

Is the bug report public.

It’s not a requirement. I just thought, that the Chromium project has a 
big QA setup, and runs on millions of devices, it’d be good to know, for 
example, if the patch was battle proven for several months in production 
or if it’s verified by one person.


Kind regards,

Paul
