I've trying to get a btmon trace but the problem of devices failing to connect has become intermittent. I pulled the
latest changes from Linus' tree this morning and built and installed the related kernel. When connection fails I see the
header it always spits out, but nothing else. When connection succeeds, there is plenty of output.

Tomorrow, I'll turn on debug in bluetoothd and see what the difference between a successful and a failed connection is.
