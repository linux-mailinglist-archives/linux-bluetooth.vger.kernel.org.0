I found it in the AV/C Panel Subunit specification from 1394 trade
association. It says we want to support "hold", then we need to
frequently resend the key with "pressed" state, because if 2 seconds
passed without the TG receiving it, then the TG will assume a
"release" state is sent (but is lost).
Also, the specification doesn't support multiple simultaneous button
presses, because we are supposed to send "release" before sending a
new "pressed" key, so I think we don't need to track the status for
each request.
