Hi,
sorry to address both list, but this issue seems related, without knowing w=
here lies the issue
my hardware : https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Lenovo_Yoga_900
I use the pre-built gentoo linux kernel,=20
6.2.8-gentoo-dist #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Mar 22 17:15:39 -00 2023 x86_6=
4 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux

since a few update (sadly I didn't noted the latest kernel version that did=
n't had the issue), after a boot, the bluetooth isn't working, nothing bad =
in dmesg, I just have to unload btusb module and modprobe it again to have =
bluetooth working again...

after a suspend to ram, I have to power off-power on the bluetooth to have =
it work again (bluetoothctl power off; bluetoothctl power on)

bluetooth mouse can also be extremely laggy sometimes,but without error mes=
sage in dmesg, most of the time `bluetoothctl power` off-on cycling do solv=
e the issue....

I also included the usb mailing list because it might be related to some be=
havior I noticed :

I have usb3.0 micro sd card reader (SanDisk MobileMate UHS-I microSD Reader=
/Writer USB 3.0 Reader, Kingston MobileLite Plus (MLPM) microSD Card Reader=
 USB 3.1 microSDHC/SDXC UHS-II, for example) and some extra fast micro sd c=
ards (like sandisk extrem 512G), when transfering data the read rate can be=
 as high as 110Mo/s and write 70Mo/s sustained, nothing impressive but when=
 such rate is achieved for a long time (big file transfer) either reading o=
nly access, writing only access or read write, the usb bus become unusable,=
 I can't even use a usb mouse connected to it by wire... even if cpu usage =
is really low (less than 10%)=20
I don't have the issue if I connect a M2 usb3 flash drive, with comparable =
transfert speed... so not related to some bus over usage... =20

so I suspect that there is an issue with the usb driver, and that maybe the=
 bluetooth issue can be related to the usb issue, since the bluetooth contr=
oller is on the usb bus on the laptop

the transfer issue of usb is much more older than the bluetooth issue, it's=
 approximative, but :
 - the btusb boot issue is about 3 month old,=20
 - the suspend/resume issue of bluetooth is more than a year old
 - the usb transfer issue as more than a year...

I'll gladly provide any useful information, can also do patch tries...=20

thanks and regards
JLM
