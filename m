In our case we'd definitely use pwrseq for PCIe bus and we can also
benefit from using pwrseq for serdev and for platform busses also (for
the same story of WiFi+BT chips).

I can take a look at rewriting pwrseq code to also handle the PCIe
bus. Rewriting it to be a generic lib seems like an easy task,
plugging it into PCIe code would be more fun.

Platform and serdev... Definitely even more fun.

Let's see if the kernel.org email will get to him.
