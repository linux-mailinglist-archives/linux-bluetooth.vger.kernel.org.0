Hi Sebastian,

> There was a lockdep which led to commit
>   fad003b6c8e3d ("Bluetooth: Fix inconsistent lock state with RFCOMM")
> 
> Lockdep noticed that `sk->sk_lock.slock' was acquired without disabling
> the softirq while the lock was also used in softirq context.
> Unfortunately the solution back then was to disable interrupts before
> acquiring the lock which however made lockdep happy.
> It would have been enough to simply disable the softirq. Disabling
> interrupts before acquiring a spinlock_t is not allowed on PREEMPT_RT
> because these locks are converted to 'sleeping' spinlocks.
> 
> Use spin_lock_bh() in order to acquire the `sk_lock.slock'.
