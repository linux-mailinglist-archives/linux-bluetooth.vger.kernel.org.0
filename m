To tests if absolute volume is working on redmi note 4 I used two
different a2dp sink devices, yamaha rx-v485 av receiver and sony
wh-ch510 headphones. The AVRCP version was read from "sdptool browse"
output running on my linux machine.
So in this case, the absolute volume was not working at all on this
phone despite the fact that it should (developer options were set to
enable absolute volume). Also the absolute volume on this phone was
not working with bluez no matter what the order of init calls.

I know You were explaining that already but for me it is still a mystery ..=
.
In AVRCP specification v1.6.2 (this is the newest one on the bluetooth
sig site) in paragraph 2.2.1 (Roles) there is:
"The controller (CT) is a device that initiates a transaction by
sending a command frame to a target."
So if the device wants to send a command it must play the controller
role. And SetAbsoluteVolume is the command that is sent from the phone
when you press volume up/down on the phone. So To support absolute
volume the phone has to be a controller (and the target to handle
play/pause etc. commands).
Next in the same specification in chapter 8 (Service discovery
interoperability requirements) there is:
"This profile defines the following service records for the CT and the
TG, respectively." and below is definition of those records.
So I understand it that if phone wants to send SetAbsoluteVolume
command it must implement the controller role (CT) and define the
service record with services "A/V Remote ControlI" (0x110E) and "A/V
Remote Control Controller" (0x110F) in "Service Class ID List" field.

And in case of redmi 8, this phone does not define such service record
and still it sends SetAbsoluteVolume commands.

So either this phone is not respecting the specification or I totally
missed the point. (I guess the second ...)
