These are two different issues. The issue with bad applications can be
overcome with D-Bus policy. The issue with multiple providers is
inherent: we have to have a duplicate resolution because one device
may report battery from different sources, e.g. via HFP and A2DP at
the same time. The latter case is rare in practice but still possible,
so I propose the simplest duplication resolution which is accept the
first provider registered (of that specific device) and ignore the
rest.

Coupling Battery1 with Profile1 will limit the flexibility of this
feature. For example, some speakers report battery status via a
separate LE channel (GATT). If we require Battery provider to be also
a registered Profile, we won't be able to support these cases since
GATT clients do not register any profile.
