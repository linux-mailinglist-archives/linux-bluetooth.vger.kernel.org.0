Jamie,

I completely agree that different devices should (and need to) be able 
to negotiate their own desired connection interval... as long as the 
connection interval that they want to use is within the bounds that I as 
a Linux system administrator have allowed my system to operate.

Admittedly, the current situation is not good because the default values 
are 24/40, so without additional modification (which it turns out may 
not be easy or possible if you don't have debugfs) a device can only 
negotiate a connection interval between 30ms and 50ms otherwise it will 
receive a negative/rejection response.  But if we were to change the 
default values to 6/3200, then any device would be able to negotiate 
it's own desired connection interval between 7.5ms and 4000ms and 
additional configuration would be required to restrict that range.

I think that if multiple BLE devices were connected to my Linux machine, 
the BLE radio would have to "wake up" on the schedule of the shortest 
connection interval, so I'm not convinced that you would actually get 
any benefit from a min/max per client.  But I do agree that I like 
having that level of control.  If we did want to support a min/max per 
client, information is already stored per-client in 
/var/lib/bluetooth/<DEVICE_MAC>/ (for secure keys and other things) and 
we could probably add min/max configuration down there somewhere.  Maybe 
it could even just override the global min/max in the debugfs area.

But also please note that the patch in question does not know or care 
how the current connection's interval was configured.  It could be from 
a global setting, or it could be device-specific configuration.  All it 
knows is that the current connection has min/max values, and if the 
remote device requests to change the connection interval, the requested 
value should be checked against the min/max bounds of that connection.

If the desired behavior were for Linux to blindly accept and return a 
successful response for any connection interval change request value, 
then it makes no sense to have a min/max at all. The min/max would 
essentially be any value allowed by the bluetooth spec, and having the 
notion of a min/max connection interval is confusing and misleading.  I 
believe that if you have bounds defined, then values should be checked 
against those bounds.

Regards,

Carey
