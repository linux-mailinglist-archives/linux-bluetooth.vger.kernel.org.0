Changes only get backported once they hit mainline, which hasn't
happened yet. And to get them into the net branch (and from there to
mainline) a new commit is needed anyway, so you might as well add the
stable tag to it. Side note: And don't worry that identical commit is
already in -next, git handles that well afaik (but if you rebase
bluetooth-next for other reasons anyway you might as well remove it).
