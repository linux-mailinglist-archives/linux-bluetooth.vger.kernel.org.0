I have the feeling that it might be better to add an option to also define the security level via socket options. So you can either use the pre-defined ones or just build your own. That way we can add new levels via userspace changes. I am almost certain that with future specs, we have to add new security levels since everybody is pondering on legacy pairing etc. So the FIPS level might be just too much, but you want Secure Connections and 128-bit key size, but are fine with just works.

And I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if an upgrade from AES-128 has to happen at some point as well.

Marcel
