So your answer means that we cannot use ofono at all and therefore we
need another daemon (like my proposed hsphfpd).

My proposed hsphfpd is going to support both roles. Which means to
implement whole HFP profile. So for connecting bluetooth headsets (when
AG role is needed on desktop) and also for connecting mobile phones
(when HF role is needed on desktop).

And my primary motivation is for bluetooth headsets as this is what are
asking desktop and laptop users again and again that is missing on Linux
systems.

So higher priority has AG role and slightly lower priority has HF role.

Codecs needs to be configured also in AG role. Before accepting SCO
connection you need to configure SCO socket for correct codec. Also for
vendor codecs it needs to be properly negotiated via AT commands.

I know that it is not so easy to implement --- I already created
prototype implementation and proposed API how to do it.

Yes. Exactly.

So if you are disagreeing with this design, can you propose alternative?
Which would support needs for desktop users? Support for HSP profile (in
AG role), support for HFP profile (in AG role), ability to parse and
interpret needed AT commands. And later also HS and HF role of these
profiles.

AG.

Ok. So I guess now you understood main problem. I thought it was
obvious, but seems that bluetooth HFP is too complicated, so talking
about it always needs more detailed explanation. Sorry for that if it
was not clear from my side since beginning what are requirements for my
setup.

And question now is how to solve this problem for desktop computers?
Users who want to use their bluetooth headset (HF role on headset; AG
role on laptop) really do not want to do complicated setup of modem
simulator just to use microphone input from headset.

This is reason why I'm proposing hsphfpd daemon and with its API to work
without any modem emulator or ofono software (but optionally modem could
be connected).
