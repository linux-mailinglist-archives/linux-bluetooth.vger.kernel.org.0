I would suggest that the D-Bus API would be a more appropriate way to
get the information you want.

The "get managed objects" functionality is a good way to iterate
through all the devices that BlueZ knows about.
There are examples at:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/test/bluezutils.py
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/test/list-devices

The D-Bus API also allows your code to execute callbacks when a device
is added or its connection state changes.
This is done with the InterfacesAdded and PropertiesChanged signals.

If you are going to use Python I would suggest the
https://pypi.org/project/pydbus/ library is a more "Pythonic" set of
D-Bus bindings.

The API is documented at:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc

Regards,
Barry
