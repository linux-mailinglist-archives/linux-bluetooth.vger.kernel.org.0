I know :-) I have one of those your devel kits with jumpers for
selecting SDIO/USB/UART interface.

The nice feature of Enhanced Setup Synchronous Connection HCI command is
that you can choose routing (HCI or PCI) as argument of this command.

If your adapter supports standard Enhanced Setup Synchronous Connection
HCI command and implement it according to specification, then yes, it
should support changing it via command without need to set any quirk or
jumper on board.

You may verify what your adapters support by script sco_features:
