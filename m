Hi Joseph,

>  What I plan to do about adapter power cycle for quality report:
> 
>  Step 1: At power off, do not clear the flag of HCI_QUALITY_REPORT in
> hci_dev_clear_volatile_flags(). Will use HCI_QUALITY_REPORT to track
> if the quality report is enabled before power off. Will also disable
> the quality report explicitly in hci_sync.c:hci_dev_open_sync() just
> before aosp_do_close()  so that different vendor chips will have
> quality off at power off.
> 
>  Step 2: In hci_sync.c:hci_dev_open_sync(), re-enable quality report
> explicitly just after aosp_do_open() if HCI_QUALITY_REPORT is true so
> that all vendor chips have quality back on at power on.
> 
>  If the quality report is not enabled before power cycle,
> HCI_QUALITY_REPORT will always stay false. Nothing mentioned above
> will be executed in this case.
> 
>  One thing is worth noting here. The HCI_QUALITY_REPORT represents
> the host setting instead of the controller state. During power off,
> the HCI_QUALITY_REPORT host setting remains true while the controller
> state about quality report is turned off. This behavior is similar to
> "wide-band-speech" whose setting remains true during power off.

yes, that sounds good. Please provide the mgmt addition as first patches.

Regards

Marcel
