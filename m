We don't block suspend if preparing for suspend fails so it's useful
to know when a suspend was attempted. Also, having the suspend event
emitted acts as an anchor that lets us search through the HCI trace
quickly and observe what happened around it to cause an unexpected
state.

Sure, we can reduce the wake_reason to 0 =3D Unexpected, 1 =3D Non
bluetooth source, 2 =3D Device Connection.

I think a distinct event is preferable to adding another bit to Device
Connected.
a) It acts as an anchor point for searching an HCI trace for suspend occurr=
ing.
b) It is resilient to failures in any of the connection events (since
the Device Connected event sometimes requires subsequent calls to the
controller before the connection completes).
c) Properly captures wake from unexpected events. This is really nice
to understand what events came BEFORE the PM_SUSPEND_DONE event was
sent by the kernel and would help identify suspend bugs and
regressions.
