Hi Patrick,

> Starting with the upgrade to v5.8-rc3, I've noticed I wasn't able to
> connect to my Bluetooth headset properly anymore. While connecting to
> the device would eventually succeed, bluetoothd seemed to be confused
> about the current connection state where the state was flapping hence
> and forth. Bisecting this issue led to commit 3ca44c16b0dc (Bluetooth:
> Consolidate encryption handling in hci_encrypt_cfm, 2020-05-19), which
> refactored `hci_encrypt_cfm` to also handle updating the connection
> state.
> 
> The commit in question changed the code to call `hci_connect_cfm` inside
> `hci_encrypt_cfm` and to change the connection state. But with the
> conversion, we now only update the connection state if a status was set
> already. In fact, the reverse should be true: the status should be
> updated if no status is yet set. So let's fix the isuse by reversing the
> condition.
