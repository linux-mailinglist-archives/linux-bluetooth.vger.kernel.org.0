In your list are missing another two use cases:

4. AG role without real modem connecting yo HS role in HSP profile

5. HS role connecting to AG role in HSP profile


3. and 4. is my primary focus which is the most common scenario for
desktop / laptop users with bluetooth headset. 5., 2. and 1. are also
covered in hsphfpd design, but with lower priority (implemented after 3.
and 4. is fully working).

3. and 4. would share some part of code, specially handling of battery
status parsing via CSR and Apple extensions or CSR codec selection.

What do you suggest for 4. and 5.?

bluez & pulseaudio developers told me that it would be a good idea to
avoid implementing a new AT parser for telephony stack. And rather use
ofono implementation for telephony part...

But if I should use existing DBus API provided by ofono, it means that I
need to do parsing of all AT commands (including telephony) and
translate them to ofono DBus API.

I agree, this should work and there is not need to modify ofono. But it
means that in hsphfpd daemon I need to have full AT parser for all
telephony commands and it was something which bluez / pa developers
thought that should be avoided. Therefore I come up with idea that
telephony commands would be handled by external Telephony Agent, which
can be ofono.

Anyway, what is the problem with accepting modem socket in ofono via
DBus and starts talking with it like with any other modem which ofono
supports? Currently ofono already takes modem socket from bluez via DBus
API, so in same way hsphfpd can pass modem socket to ofono. Basically
ofono then can reuse same code which already uses for sockets from
bluez, just it do not have to parse and interpret audio related AT
commands (as these are handled by hsphpfd itself).

What are exact issues? I do not see complexity at ofono part (as has
already everything implemented) and currently I do not see those "other"
issues.

And this is why I started discussion across all projects (pulseaudio,
bluez, ofono) so describe current problem and come up with some
architecture which would be suitable for all projects. So thanks for all
your points.

You suggested to use phone simulator together with ofono and then
starts extending / patching phone simulator to supports all needed parts
which are in my hsphfpd design (battery status, button press, codec
selection)?

Also how to handle the main problem of phone simulator that it is too
much complicated to setup it on desktop? Looking at the steps...

https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Blu=
etooth/#index5h2

=2E.. that desktop user needs to run nontrivial commands in command like,
plus creating configuration file only just to connect bluetooth headset
is ridiculous and non-acceptable for desktop application.

If this problem is not fixed, ofono and phone simulator are not usable
as "main" software implementation of HFP profile for usage of bluetooth
headsets on Linux.
