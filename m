No, it does not mean mSBC.

If you want to query if your bluetooth adapter supports hw mSBC then you
need to check OCF_READ_LOCAL_CODECS command. You can look into script
sco_features.pl for details.

Note that currently it is not possible to send OCF_READ_LOCAL_CODECS
command from non-root user as kernel currently does not allow it.

Yes. "/bin/hciconfig voice" allows to set only voice settings for old
Add Synchronous Connection HCI command which does not support hw mSCB.

For usage mSBC hw encoder you need to use Enhanced Setup Synchronous
Connection HCI command for establishing SCO connection.

For using HW encoder you need to stop feeding socket with mSBC encoded
data and instead put into this socket RAW pcm samples. Also you need
somehow inform kernel about this change.

For both things I designed new setsockopt() API which I described in:
