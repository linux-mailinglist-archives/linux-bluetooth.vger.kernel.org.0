Wireshark record of the Bluetooth connection between the two laptops

I have four devices:
 - a openSUSE Tumbleweed laptop running the 5.8.10-1-default x86_64 kernel
   (Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0a2b Intel Corp. Bluetooth wireless interface)
 - a Debian Buster laptop also running the 5.7.0-0.bpo.2-amd64 kernel
   (Bus 002 Device 002: ID 04ca:300d Lite-On Technology Corp. Atheros AR3012
Bluetooth)
 - a Sony Bluetooth headset
 - an old Android 6 phone

Both laptop run Bluez 5.55 and Pulseaudio 13.0.

The Debian laptop acts as a bluetooth headset (it is supposed to receive sound
from devices). No GUI is running on it so configuration is manual.

The headset connects fine to the phone and the openSUSE laptop. The phone
connects to both laptops without issue, with sound working using A2DP.

Connecting from the Debian laptop to the openSUSE laptop only allows HSP (A2DP
is not available).

Connecting from the openSUSE laptop to the Debian laptop crashes Bluez on the
openSUSE laptop (segmentation fault). It does not matter if I connect using the
KDE Plasma applet or bluetoothctl. 

The crash happens because in function store_remote_sep, the service pointer is
NULL. Adding the following check:

    if (!service) return

right after:

    struct avdtp_service_capability *service = avdtp_get_codec(sep->sep);

allows a successful connection without crash and A2DP is available, however,
there is no sound.

rewinding the execution, avdtp_register_sep gets a NULL codec_type parameter,
coming from endpoint->codec in endpoint_init_a2dp_sink, the remaining backtrace
being:

There could be two problems here:
 - a missing null check
 - a codec incorrectly set to NULL. I've not yet traced back this NULL value.
This could be caused by a configuration error on my part, but something is
fishy since the phone successfully connects so it seemingly has the all the
information information it needs to stream sound (or makes assumption of what
is supported instead of checking, I don't know). 

I'm attaching:
 - a Wireshark capture of the connection
 - a record of the execution done using rr (`rr replay file` to replay)
containing the whole execution state.

Notes:
 - In GDB, setting a breakpoint in store_remote_sep makes Bluez not crash.
 - rr itself crashes on my openSUSE laptop when trying to record the execution,
unless running it in gdb like this: gdb -ex run -ex cont --args rr record
/usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd -d

Let me know if I can provide further information. I am very curious about this
crash.
