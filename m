I wonder if this is the best name.

Do we care about just the enabled experimental features or the overall supported experimental features as well. And please keep in mind that we also have per-adapter vs global experimental features. So we should distinguish here as well.

We also need to document that this property is only available if bluetoothd is started with -E and otherwise this property is omitted.

My proposal would be to at least name it ExperimentalSupport or ExperimentalFeatures to give us a path to nicely extend it if needed.

Regards

Marcel
