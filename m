I'm not following you on this, the distros don't have uapi headers
that match their kernel release? Afaik being a kernel uapi means these
APIs are considered stable and I suspect they haven't been changed in
a while, you are right that this introduces a kernel dependency if we
were to use new members but I still think this is better than having
copies that at some point goes out of sync, specially when nothing
indicates that things like input_event was not accepted by the kernel.

I didn't introduce the usage of any new symbols, so the only new
requirement is that linux/uinput.h and linux/uhid.h headers exist, I
could however rollback if we have another way to check if those
headers exists use then otherwise we can keep using copies, perhaps
move then under linux/ directory, anyway it is not like we don't have
kernel dependencies already and we actually have been debating on
having the bluetooth socket definitions as part of the uapi instead of
libbluetooth, so we will need to sort out how we can update the
userspace parts with new kernel interface without breaking the build
on systems that don't actually ship with e.g. linux/bluetooth.h.
