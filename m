Sure, it's just that not only hcidump likely to not be installed by default or
even packaged, the fact that it's long time obsoleted means that it can also be
incorrect and no one is going to debug it. btmon's file dumps are binary
though, so you would need to use `tee` to dump text as it scrolls or use `btmon
-r`.

I might have made that dump with '-S' option which adds SCO messages that
otherwise might be ignored, just for completeness.

DualShocks 3 and 4 are fiddly to connect, when connecting to "new" dongle you
need to:
1) Remove any OS entries of it.
2) Force DS4 into pairing mode by holding SELECT+PS until light flashes
rapidly, for DS3 you need to connect it to USB. It will write dongle's MAC/UID
into itself.
3) Now you can switch it on normally. I'm pretty sure DS wants to be the master
in that connection.

It works fine on my old 2.x ISSC dongle which I tried to replace with fancier
4.x dongles twice while having 2.x as backup. First 4.x dongle killed itself
for no reason a minute after plugging in, bastards didn't even refund me for
its corpse. And second one is this CSR. But timeouts seem irrelevant, sometimes
they just don't react properly fast enough during pairing and they also refuse
to connect to a dongle that's not in their memory.

On Windows I just use Windows' stock drivers and DS4Windows
https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows for polling rate / latency, lights
controls, battery state tracking and xinput emulation. On Linux there is no
control (polling/latency would be really nice for battery/responsiveness
balancing and parity with new generation of consoles that advertise 1ms
wireless latency which DS4 should be well capable of) but I'm trying out
https://github.com/TheDrHax/ds4drv-cemuhook now. 

I think that Windows' BT stack just not as picky. There is no way they would do
per-device workarounds for garbage bin dongles like that. They JUST recently
(like last year or something) added USB audio driver after years of relying on
crappy, often licensed separately, third-party per-device implementations.

Fails for me with "Can't execute command: No such device or address (6)"
