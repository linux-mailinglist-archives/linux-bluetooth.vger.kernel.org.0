Luiz, I'm sorry. I do not want a crash instead. I didn't understand that 
the solution I proposed (i.e. adding Zijun's logic without removing KK's 
logic) would introduce a new crash opportunity. I previously thought you 
were saying one of the following things:
1. The crash opportunity already existed due the init/shudown sequences.
2. The crash opportunity already existed due the init/shudown sequences 
when removing KK's logic.

If it was #1, I was hoping that adding the logic would make the risk no 
worse.

If it was #2, I was hoping that my suggestion of adding Zijun's logic 
without removing KK's logic might represent an acceptable middleground 
for a temporary fix that would "correct" the logic without introducing a 
new crash opportunity.

I feel like I may not be clear about what I mean by adding Zijun's logic 
and not removing KK's logic. Maybe something like this diff:

diff --git a/drivers/bluetooth/hci_qca.c b/drivers/bluetooth/hci_qca.c

                                                sizeof(ibs_wake_cmd));

I think this diff is mangled due to using Thunderbird, but I hope this 
helps convey what I was asking about.

If I am understanding you correctly now, you are saying that simply 
introducing Zijun's logic (without removing KK's logic) will introduce a 
new crash opportunity. Is that correct?

Thanks,
wt
