I don=E2=80=99t see how that makes it simpler or cleaner. In the end you ju=

Ah got it, is there really a max_len for variable size though? Or you
mean to say that should be limited to event buffer size? That Im
afraid we only discover at runtime, anyway usually for variable size
we should be using flex_array_size but that requires accessing the
received skb so we can't really tell at build time and it will be
likely left for the callback to figure out it has received enough data
or not.
