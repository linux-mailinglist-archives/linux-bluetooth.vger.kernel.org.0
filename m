Yep, and while at it implement the so called Robust Caching feature so
we can detect if anything has changed by reading the DB Hash.

When you say the app can't handle changed service do you mean BlueZ
doesn't emit changes to the attributes (via Service Changed) or is it
really the application not being able to handle the changes?

we upgrade the build from 100 to 101, the app gets the wrong data. We looke=
d at the log. When the app tries to read temperature by using the temperatu=
re UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received the request to r=
ead the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device name" is returned t=
o the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavior as the blue=
tooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/bluetooth/[BT_MAC]/c=
ache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files in the folder=
. That means the disabled cache seems working.

So BlueZ is acting as the server, right? The Cache only applies to the
client portion, there is no such thing as disabling the remote cache.
I don't see any incoming Read By Group Request from the remote so it
is very likely that it has cached the values, there is no Read By Type
for the DB Hash either which is quite surprising to me since that is
required for stacks supporting Robust Caching which I believe is the
case of iOS.

Anyway, I would check that the following lines are being triggered:

When starting:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/src/gatt-database.c=
#n3798

On connect:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/src/gatt-database.c=
#n3741

If those lines are not being triggered it is likely a client problem
which for some reason had not subscribed to received service changes
for some reason, if it doesn't subscribe to service changes then it
shall not cache any attribute and attempt to rediscover on every
connection.
