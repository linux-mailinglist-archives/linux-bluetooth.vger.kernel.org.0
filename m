after we fixed the bug with the SCO packet flags, we might not even need this anymore at all and just enable the error reporting unconditionally.

On a side note, I insisted on calling this WIDEBAND_SPEECH option since we should be hiding details behind a single flag and not spread multiple flags for things that need to be combined into one logical feature anyway.
