you might be right here since the patches for LL Privacy are taking a while to get into good shape to be merged.

I wonder now if the Add Device action 1 which meant incoming connections only is working correctly (or we use it correctly). For LE that meant Directed Advertising and for that there is a special mode to use the whitelist and only forward PRAs for resolution to the host. It needs a controller with support for that. But I need to go back and check that this is not accidentally broken.

Lets try to integrate PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE into the Bluetooth core. Then we see if we need to inform bluetoothd via mgmt at all about this change or if we can just handle things accordingly. We can then see what bluetoothd needs extra to handle resuming discovery gracefully.

If we want to differentiate between device allowed to wake us up and device that don’t, then we need to create that list first. Right now we don’t really do that. And I think we don’t have an easy way to tell the kernel via mgmt what this list will be.

I was thinking to either add action 3 to Add Device which means the same as action 1, but allow wakeup. Or we are adding an Add Extended Device that we give a flags parameter for specifying a flag. I would not do that with the connection parameters command since the flow is a bit different there.

Initially I would just enable it for HID devices only and then see how that works. If we need to expose this via D-Bus, then we do that once we have the kernel bits working correctly and tested.

>> We need to define what discovery is. My understand is that discovery is always user triggered way of actively finding a specific device around you. In most cases because you want to pair with it. The way how mgmt works is that we discovery only for a period of time. And bluetoothd turns it into a continuous discovery as long as a specific UI portion is open and requesting it. Unless discovery has a different meaning, then a simple restart is enough.

As mentioned above, lets figure this out when the core bits are working. We do have to abort an ongoing inquiry and active scan for sure.

>>> We expect this will result in the following:
>>> * Classic: A paired device can wake the host if it's in the event filter
>>> * LE: A paired device can wake the host if it's in the whitelist and

>> 
>> Do we need this for classic? I agree that we should abort the inquiry procedure if one is active, but do we really want to deal with the event filter? It is one of these old Bluetooth 1.0b concepts in HCI that are not as well defined as others since you have no idea what the controllers supports and how many devices they support.

If you are using Add Device and leave connectable=false, then when adding a BR/EDR it will become connectable for you. So we change the API to allow the global connectable to stay off and if only a device is added via Add Device, we will enable connectable. Since for BR/EDR we use Add Device only for HID devices, the list of HID devices that you want as wakeup source are automatically in here.

That said, I have no objections with using the event filter for BR/EDR. I just have the feeling it is not as urgent as with LE.

Awesome. Feel free to send RFC that we can give a spin.
