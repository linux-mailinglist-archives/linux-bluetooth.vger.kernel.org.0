Sorry, I lost track, if it’s still about one regression, you 
successfully bisected or not.

Anyway, passing through the USB Bluetooth device to QEMU helped me [1], 
and might help you to overcome the dependency problems. (My steps 
actually worked, but turned out the Linux kernel commit I tested with 
had another regression not making the Bluetooth controller initialize.)

Marcel also replied, he is using btproxy to debug issues, but I did not 
try it, as it wasn’t clear to me how to get it working easily, and he 
also wrote something about non-public patches.


Kind regards,

Paul
