 you are still talking to a SSP device. This has to do with the fact that t=

Legacy pairing is still indicated with MGMT_DEV_FOUND_LEGACY_PAIRING
so for what is worth this didn't change any logic regarding how legacy
pairing is detected, in fact hci_conn_ssp_enabled is used to determine
if encryption is required or not for low security it was never used to
detect if the paring method used was really SSP or legacy.

If you guys agree I can prepare a patch requiring SSP to be used, but
first we will need to agree on what action we would take under such
situation, shall we disconnect if we figure out the SSP bit is
disabled? Btw, if the remote device has dropped SSP for some reason (I
suppose the spec allows doing it) and we have a EIR on the cache
(which we keep for 30 seconds) that doesn't necessarily mean the
device is broken since the use of EIR may have been dropped in the
meantime.
