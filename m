because the monitoring socket also records other binaries opening certain Bluetooth specific sockets.

And that is for exactly this reason. Something stupid is going on in your system.

It is a socket. Many tools can dump the raw socket. I think it would be a 3 liner in Python for example. Use tshark or something alike if you want a raw data stream. Looking at raw HCI data is totally pointless.
