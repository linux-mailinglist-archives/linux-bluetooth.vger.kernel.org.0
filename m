I just realized that I should have opened this one and add the
chipmarkings to the commit msg here too. So I've just opened it
and took a look.

This one has a Barrot 8041a02 chip and searching for 8041a92 shows that
the internet is full of reports of how crappy it is.

I guess this patch probably will get some review remarks anyways,
but let me know if you want a v3 with just the chip added to the
commit msg.

Regards,

Hans
