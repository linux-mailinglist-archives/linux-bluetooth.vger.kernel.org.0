In an ideal case I'd say yes, but that's also proven not to be a
reliable metric.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be covered by
qualification program and as a result, it is largely not trustworthy.

1 and the HCI Reset on init. We got that wrong by whitelisting
hardware and it came to bite us badly when the number of controllers
increased that just got the spec right.
I'm afraid I don't have a good exit plan for this at the moment.  It
may be something we either need to have some sort of extention for the
hardware to report the appropriate support or better, fix the
compliance gap so after a particular HCI version the bit field becomes
trustworthy.
