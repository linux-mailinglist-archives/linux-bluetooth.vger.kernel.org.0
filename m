Ok, so can pulseaudio do following?

Call RegisterApplication. If success then expects that codec switching
is possible and via GetManagedObjects exports all available codecs.
If RegisterApplication fails then fallback to RegisterEndpoint, expects
that codec switching is not possible and so register only one SBC codec.
