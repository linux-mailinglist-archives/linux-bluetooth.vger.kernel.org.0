I have a vague memory that there was an interoperability issue around
this that required the initiator to know ahead of time if SSP was
supported by the remote host before connecting which was the reason
why this was added in the first place.  However, I agree that this can
also be read after you are connected rather than just waiting for a
RNR page to complete just to page again.  The point here however is
about the signals that SSP should be supported and the conditions
where we let legacy pairing go through.  My assertion is that EIR
implies SSP, so legacy pairing shouldn't be allowed in that case.
It's not a definitive security measure, but IMO, every signals that we
can get will help close a door to downgrade attacks.

 It is just that our inquiry cache was never designed for that. It was just=
 to speed up the connection process.
Ack.  This definitely looks like an opportunity.  We can add it to the back=
log.
