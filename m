There is still hope, especially since there is already kernel support for t=
he
chipset itself, just the firmware is problematic apparently, and it's even
harder since there is no real date timestamp on the firmware itself, so you
can't even know if the driver with a higher version number contains an actu=
al
updated firmware or not; I hope it does, at least :P=20

According to a similar chip from the Realtek site
(https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl876=
3b)
mentioned in the github thread linked above, the supported codec are AAC and
SBC, so in theory it should work, but AFAIK bluetooth audio on Linux is a
little bit of a lottery, unfortunately.

Glad to see it works now :)

I still hope that Realtek will give us proper firmware support, though.
