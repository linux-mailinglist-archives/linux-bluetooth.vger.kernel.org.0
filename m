Yes, that is truth. My point is just about validity of LastUsed value.

But this may happen. And such thing is allowed. Any application,
including unprivileged can register own new endpoint to bluez. It is not
specific to pulseaudio. And in my opinion central bluetooth daemon which
expose such functionality should be robust and be prepared that
application on "other side of dbus IPC" does not have to be well
behaved.

That is truth.

My idea was to encode just dbus path of local dbus endpoint. We can say
(in IPC API) that client application should preserve dbus path for one
same endpoint between dbus daemon / computer restarts. Because otherwise
functionality of "choose last used endpoint" would not work.

This is less strict requirement and current one (that registration order
of all existing applications in system must be same across reboots),
less error prone and still should be easily implemented.

Or once we include support for dynamic codec loading (based on encoder
library presence in system), installation of any irrelevant application
may bring a new supported codec and therefore a new endpoint. So codecs
can become in any order...

Or another example, when different application (not PA) register also
some endpoint.

Yes, whole thing is only about initial codec selection. In the worst
case user would have pre-selected different codec as which was last
used.

But I think that storing dbus path of endpoint as described above should
be more reliable solution.

Applications (e.g. PA) talking to bluetooth daemon does not register or
request directly SEID. Instead they register their dbus path and dbus
connection and bluetooth daemon later allocates SEID for that path.
