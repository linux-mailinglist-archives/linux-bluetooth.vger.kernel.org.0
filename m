Hi Kiran,

> For NOP command, need to cancel work scheduled on cmd_timer,
> on receiving command status or commmand complete event.

> Below use case might lead to race condition multiple when NOP
> commands are queued sequentially:
> 
> hci_cmd_work() {
>   if (atomic_read(&hdev->cmd_cnt) {
>            .
>            .
>            .
>      atomic_dec(&hdev->cmd_cnt);
>      hci_send_frame(hdev,...);
>      schedule_delayed_work(&hdev->cmd_timer,...);
>   }
> }
> 
> On receiving event for first NOP, the work scheduled on hdev->cmd_timer
> is not cancelled and second NOP is dequeued and sent to controller.
> 
> While waiting for an event for second NOP command, work scheduled on
> cmd_timer for the first NOP can get scheduled, resulting in sending third
> NOP command (sending back to back NOP commands). This might
> cause issues at controller side (like memory overrun, controller going
> unresponsive) resulting in hci tx timeouts, hardware errors etc.

> The fix to this issue is to cancel the delayed work scheduled on
> cmd_timer on receiving command status or command complete event for
> NOP command (this patch handles NOP command same as any other SIG
> command).
