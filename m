I did see Zijun's claim of that. However, I think that both KK and Luiz 
are not convinced by the explanation. Also, if that explanation does 
convince KK and Luiz, I think that the explanation needs to be added to 
the commit message.

I'm hoping that Luiz will at least respond to the middleground I 
proposed as a workaround.

Luiz and KK, I also want y'all to know that I really appreciate your 
striving to make this work well and taking the time to explain some of 
it to me. I know I must seem like a pest at this point, and I am sorry 
for that. I do wish I had more ability to propose a workable fix, both 
for the reason that I am personally being hurt by this problem and the 
fact that I think it reflects badly on Linux to have an issue like this 
exposed to users.
