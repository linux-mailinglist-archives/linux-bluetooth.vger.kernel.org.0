Proxy-Client should never be added to bluetooth-meshd. As you point out, a
deprecated GATT proxy client is probably "better than nothing" for
testing a GATT
proxy server.

We had hoped that the need for GATT Proxy Mesh would dissipate over
time, because
point-to-point ACL connections within the mesh ecosystem is disruptive, and
not really "mesh".

This answers one of my questions from an earlier (perhaps suppressed) respo=
nse
I made...  This is the correct architecture for adding a Proxy Server
to bluetooth-meshd.

I am officially a retiree now, but I will try to review this patch set
this week, or next
week at the latest. Between holiday trips.
