  doc/media: Add 'broadcasting' state and 'Select' method

This adds a new state for transports created by the Broadcast
Sink. Such transports will remain  in the 'idle' state until the
user calls 'Select' on them, at which point they will be moved to
'broadcasting'. This allows the user to select the desired BIS as
the audio server automatically acquires transports that are in this
state.

  transport: Add 'broadcasting' state

This adds a new state for transports created by the Broadcast
Sink device as a result of scanning a Broadcast Source. Such
transports will remain  in the 'idle' state until the user
selects them using 'transport.select', at which point they will
be moved to 'broadcasting'.

  transport: Add 'Select' method

This adds the 'Select' method for Broadcast transports. It's role
is to change the transport's state from idle to broadcasting. This
allows the user to select the desired stream when running the setup
with PipeWire since it acquires any transport that is broadcasting.

  transport: Broadcast sink: wait for user to select transport

This changes the flow for transports created on broadcast sink side.
Transports are not automatically changed to pending anymore, instead
the user must first run transport.select on them which updates the
state to 'broadcasting'. This allows for the selection of the desired
stream when running the setup with PipeWire, which acquires any transport
that is broadcasting.

  doc/media: Add 'Unselect' method

This adds the documentation for a new method, exclusive to transports
created by the Broadcast Sink. It would allow the user to terminate the
sync to a BIS, via a 2 step process. The first step is the call to this
method, which changes the transport's state to idle, with the second step
being done by the audio server which detects this change and releases
the transport.

  client/gatt: Set handle before calling print functions

The print functions (print_service, print_chrc and print_desc) all print
the handle, but the handle is never set in the struct object. This
results in the handle always printing as 0x0000. Set the handle before
calling the print function.
