Yeah, I was hoping you'd get e.g. 0 / 0 / 1 as output, suggesting it was
inactive at first but changing seats worked around the problem.
Sorry, but this means it'll be harder to debug.  Can you...

1. Check whether PBAP is registered with bluetoothctl:

       bluetoothctl show | grep 0000112e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb

   You should see one line, like:

       UUID: Phonebook Access Client   (0000112e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)

2. Tail the bluetooth and obex logs in another terminal:

       sudo journalctl -f SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=bluetoothd SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=obexd

   Steps below will ask you to "make a note" in the log
   (e.g. append "about to do XYZ" to the file) - this will tell me
   which messages were triggered by which events.

3. Make a note in the log, then stop the obex service:

       systemctl --user stop obex.service

4. Check PBAP again:

       bluetoothctl show | grep 0000112e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb

   You should not see any output.

5. Make another note in the log, then start the obex service:

       systemctl --user start obex.service

6. Check PBAP again:

       bluetoothctl show | grep 0000112e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb

   You should see the same as in step 1.

8. Make a final note in the log, then try ctrl+alt+F{7,8}.

9. Send me the full log with notes, or at least anything that jumps out at you

Note: the instructions above only print things that are likely to show
problems, and unlikely to contain anything that can't go in an e-mail.  You're
welcome to do `sudo journalctl -f` and or `bluetoothctl show` in another
terminal and go looking for trouble :)
