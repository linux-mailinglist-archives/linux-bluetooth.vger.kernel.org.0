does the const make a difference for integer values? For me this the difference between adding value and extra noise.

That is true, but lets be clean and use a proper storage size in the first place. Eventually we want to use the larger intervals at some point. And then you end up hunting that root cause for a complete day ;)

Separate issue and separate patch, but needs to be addressed.

It is only fine on architectures that do the unaligned access correctly. In case they donâ€™t this will result in a funny value.
