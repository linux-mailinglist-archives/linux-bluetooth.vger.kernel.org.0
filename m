actually that is on purpose. Only the socket that used a specific mgmt commands gets to see the new events. So if you have a second listening socket that just cares about the events, it has to at least issue the “read” command to tell mgmt that it does understand it. There is no point in sending out signals to all mgmt sockets if you haven’t read an initial status first. The updates would make no sense to you.
