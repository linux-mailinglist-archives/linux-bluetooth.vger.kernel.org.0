https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/src/main.conf#n30

Or are you saying this is not enough and more fields need to be added?

Well even with the kill switch for the daemon not to add another
instance of DIS the problem doesn't go away because then any other
application can register DIS as well, in fact we may need to put some
code together to stop registering multiple instances of services that
don't support such thing. Anyway if you have programmed the values on
main.conf, which is shared with classic, failing to register DIS
should have no impact.
