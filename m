I manually start bluetoothd and obexd, i.e. I stopped them from systemctl (disable and stop) and start them using cli:
$ src/bluetoothd -nd -E
$ obexd/src/obexd -nd

got:
$ client/bluetoothctl show | grep 0000112e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
	UUID: Phonebook Access Client   (0000112e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)

Yes, no output

Yes:
$ client/bluetoothctl show | grep 0000112e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
	UUID: Phonebook Access Client   (0000112e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb)

I added the logs for pbap connection.

You can find the log at https://gist.github.com/fdanis-oss/eb6fba440c6b07e9ed5a266672bdbcf3
