The difference is in the context.  In one case, the user is
deliberately trying to add a device and is cognitively within the
right context to be able to make a deliberate choice to choose a
device from the list and pair against it.  In the other, they are
receiving an unsolicited request to pair which they may or may not
understand sufficiently to make the right choice.

I agree, not all user interfaces (or frankly platforms) have the same
requirements.

I don't think re_probing is necessary in this case since we wouldn't
expect it to be "upgraded" to a bonded state.  For the golden path we
would expect to start bonded.

Again, I respect the different requirements where some platforms may
want to allow this upgrading, what I'm articulating is that some
platforms may also want to take a more secure posture and not allow
this upgrade to take place automatically and instead require that the
user deliberately initiate pairing with HID devices.  The later, more
secure posture, would be my preference for chromium platforms hence
the request to make this conditional to a configuration that can be
applied on some platforms.
