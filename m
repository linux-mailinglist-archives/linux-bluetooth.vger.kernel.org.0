Because does not provide needed API.

CVSD was never done in software. Always in hardware. As said, even now I
was not able to find bluetooth HW which would allow to do CVSD in software.

It is done by HCI commands, therefore by kernel. There is discussion for
exporting userspace <--> kernel API to allow setting arbitrary
configurations for codecs supported by bluetooth HW.

Getting list of supported codecs can be done by this script:
https://github.com/pali/hsphfpd-prototype/blob/prototype/sco_features.pl
(needs to be run as root)

Yes, via some ioctl it can be done. But bluez for other bluetooth
profiles provides this information via dbus API. As bluez does not
support HSP/HFP it expects that software which implement it, provide
needed info.

Why??? It is up to the application which owns SLC socket and this
application needs to provide API for it. Codecs are negotiated via AT
commands, so again only HFP / HSP daemon can do it.

So, why should I even consider to use ofono at all? It does not support
none of above desktop feature, it does not support extended codecs, it
does not support HSP profile and also it does not support HFP profile
without physical modem (majority of desktops and laptops).

Please, do not take me wrong but after 2.5 months long discussion I just
see that ofono does not support needed parts, there are no plans for it
and everything needed is already designed and implemented in my prototype
hsphfpd daemon.
