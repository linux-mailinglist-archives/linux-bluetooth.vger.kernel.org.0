Right, but I think this is covered by the server/client model behaviour,
so I don't think we need to care if the message was encrypted using a
known remote device key, or our local device key.

This is indeed not explicitly mentioned in the spec, but I think the
consensus is that a server model shall always send responses using a
local device key.

I think this means that the API needs to allow using either local or
remote device key when *sending* a message (i.e. use remote key for
requests and local key for responses), but API for receiving messages
needs only to differentiate between device and application keys.

I'm not sure the key selection should happen automaticall. I'd rather
have an explicit option to use local device key or remote one.

Well, at the moment they are visible in Send() call: key_index argument
accepts 0x7fff as a way to indicate that local device key should be
used.

I guess you're refering to the updated doc/mesh-api.txt, so the plain Send()
method will accept only *real* app key indexes?

Ok, got it.

I was more concerned about the CRPL size. At the moment the limit means
that a node cannot simultaneously talk to more than 10 remote nodes
because of this (mesh/appkey.c:227):

	/* Replay Cache is fixed sized */
	if (l_queue_length(key->replay_cache) >= crpl) {
		int ret = l_queue_foreach_remove(key->replay_cache,
				clean_old_iv_index, L_UINT_TO_PTR(iv_index));

		if (!ret)
			return true;
	}

Not necessarily.

I understand that in the current implementation, the storage JSON is
kept in memory as a whole (mesh_node.jconfig), so adding stuff there
indeed increases the memory footprint of a node, but it doesn't need to
be like that.

What are your thoughts on replacing the JSON storage with something
more granular? The main bluetoothd seems to use a directory structure
and INI files, but a key-value store like gdbm might also be an option,
especially for frequently changing values like the sequence number.
A database would allow us to avoid explicit caching and rely on mmap().
