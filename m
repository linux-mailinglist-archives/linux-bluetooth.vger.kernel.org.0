I was going to send one, but I was wondering if we go beyond a simple 4 octets bit list.

The encryption key size enforcement for BR/EDR is simple and depends on a supported command. And for LE we always do it. The public key validation is a bit funky since for some hardware we would need a negative feature since up to a certain time we assumed it was done the right way.

Additionally we added commands to return the max encryption key size (and some hardware has vendor commands to do so). Do we for example care if the max encryption key size supported is 56-bits or 128-bits.

I would like to spent a few brain cycles to think this through. The patch for returning “static” values is written within a few minutes once we figured out what bluetoothd needs from the kernel.

Regards

Marcel
