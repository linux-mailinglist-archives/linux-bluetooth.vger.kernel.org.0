Got it, I just don't like the naming because while it is perfectly
fine for ChromeOS to choose to only do WBS when BT_PKT_STATUS is
available, other platforms my not required that, specially since BlueZ
may also be used in carkits/IVI systems which may have been built
without PLC support.

Regarding the use of oFono, I was using more as an example that you
can set socket options before any connection is made, anyway the
setting of the erroneous command seems to be done at startup
regardless if the userspace will actually require BT_PKT_STATUS or
not, so all I'm suggesting is to check if the command was actually
used when using BT_PKT_STATUS.
