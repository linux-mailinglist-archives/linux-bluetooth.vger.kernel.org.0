Thanks Emil,

that did help and I was able to finally get a basic service working. I
would be happy to use BlueZ but I was never able to get discovery /
connection to work more than 10% of the time, so that's why I'm trying
something else.

I was also getting disconnects every 3 seconds from an unknown source. I
think I fixed that with the module parameter enable_autosuspend=N. 

This was also a subsequent "Set Extended Advertising Parameters"
command. These aren't sent from my program and nothing running on my
system seems to be talking to bluetooth.

Is this part of the BlueZ stack that's running in the kernel?
Can it be disabled?

This is the last command received:
