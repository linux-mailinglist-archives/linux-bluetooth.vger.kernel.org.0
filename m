Completely missed it, thanks! What I've discovered after sending my
mail is that I could change it using btmgmt (btmgmt set-sysconfig -v
001b:2:e02e), but having this in the config file is far more
convenient as it persists.

Yes, but even stopping the scan without the timeout increased I can't
connect to devices with advertisement intervals of 7,5s or 10s.

What I'm not sure about is if when I had transient issues connecting
to the 10s device with the timeout increased I was stopping the scan
or not, I guess I can test now easily.
