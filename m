Hi Thorsten,

No, this hasn't been addressed so far. I am also not sure how we can
help solving that particular issue.

Besides this, we have other Bluetooth issues which seem to be Kernel
regressions (where downgrading to Linux 5.15 also helps), folks see
"hci0: unexpected event for opcode" on Intel but also other systems. We
haven't bisected that issue yet. But it seems that the Bluetooth stack
is really somewhat unstable in recent releases.
