Hi Luiz,

Thanks for the update! Feel free to drop this patch if you've verified
it working. Here is how I verified my original changes for unref and
reset.
1) Intentionally changed the MGMT status other than MGMT_STATUS_SUCCESS
    in stop_discovery_complete() and start_discovery_complete() and built
    bluetoothd.
(2) In bluetoothctl console, issued scan on/scan off to invoke
    StartDiscovery and verified that new discovery requests can be processed.

For the use-after_free crash, I will take a look at the new patches.

Regards,
Miao
