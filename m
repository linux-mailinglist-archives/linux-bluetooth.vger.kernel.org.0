Hi Luiz,

The Device ID setting in the main.conf only sets the PnP ID
Characteristic under the DIS.

My service was providing other characteristics (Manufacturer Name
[2A29] & Firmware Revision [2A26]) which aren't settable with that
configuration variable.

So it'd be how would I set the above characteristics?

If this service isn't suitable to be used then that is fine if it
comes to it as I can go back to the App developers and say that it
won't be suitable to use, but unfortunately so far they're just
recommending that we keep with an older version of BlueZ where this
issue doesn't occur.
