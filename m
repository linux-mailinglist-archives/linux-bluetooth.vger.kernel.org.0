does it make sense to send a suspend event with state suspend not succeeded. That doesn’t really fit well.

So I would be using Wake_Reason as first argument. However do you need all this distinction. For example the Device Connected event could gain an extra Flags bit for wakeup. I would especially not make any distinction between the advertising types.

I am in principal fine telling bluetoothd when suspend / resume happened, but letting HCI event specifics bleed into the mgmt API is not really helpful.
