Hi,

I have some problems with a BLE remote control which only issues 
"connected=true" without "servicesResolved=true" on the first button 
pressed. Only on the second buttonPressed it also issues the 
"servicesResolved=true" together with "connected=true". So I miss the 
first button (think about the power button for the TV). I am trying to 
implement the HID profile directly, I have "hog" and "input" disabled 
for bluetoothd. I am using BlueZ 5.55 and currently I have to stick to 
kernel 5.10. It does work with another remote control. I only know about 
one difference, the newer one uses MAC address randomization. But I 
don't know if this is relevant.

As I did not find an answer in StackOverflow, I asked ChatGPT. But of 
course after some dialogues the answers change. However, it seems it may 
be required to register more than just the HID service UUID with the 
local object manager. Do I also need to register the characteristic 
UUIDs and maybe related read / write flags?

Thanks,

Martin
