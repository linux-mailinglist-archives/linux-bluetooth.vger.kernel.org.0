Hi Archie,

I have the feeling this becomes complex and hard to follow. I appreciate the comment above, but just for thoughts, would it be better to do something like this:

	/* failed_time is empty (0). Meaning no prior failure. */
	if (device->name_..failed_time == 0)
		return true;

	..

	return false;

Regards

Marcel
