5.48, which was the version available in 2018, more than 3 years/10
releases ago, a lot of things have been fixed over this time so Id
really recommend to upgrade to the latest if you want to have some
support.

 But when we upgrade the build from 100 to 101, the app gets the wrong data=
. We looked at the log. When the app tries to read temperature by using the=
 temperature UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received the re=
quest to read the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device name" is =
returned to the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavior a=
s the bluetooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/bluetooth/=
[BT_MAC]/cache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files in =
the folder. That means the disabled cache seems working.
