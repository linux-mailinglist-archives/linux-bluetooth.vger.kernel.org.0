Definitely worth reconsidering.  We've recently introduced a ConnectLE
Api as a stop gap measure for something very similar.  I'd love to see
the equivalent of a ConnectClassic / ConnectLE distinction.

However, I still believe the "Generic" Connect serves its purpose as
you alluded to above.  Even if it could be built using layers, I still
believe there is value from a telemetry POV to understand the errors
from the field better and there, the distinction between the specific
transport matter.  Just like today, I suspect many applications will
continue to use the generic "Connect" as to not replicate the logic it
ultimately implements for dealing with dual mode devices, yet
results/metrics would be important.

The team strives to improve interoperability at a large scale in the
ecosystem, I believe these data point distinctions are a critical
enabler to get better insights into the specific errors customers are
seeing.  A counter proposal that would be acceptable to you, achieves
the objectives and that the team can implement would be a nice next
step.

Thanks!
