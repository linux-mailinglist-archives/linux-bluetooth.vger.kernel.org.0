Recent experience with the equivalent FluidSynth patch shows that,
if a package maintainer upgrades without adding the tmpfile,
the above causes the service to fail in ways that users find confusing.

One solution would be to prefix a '-' to make systemd ignore errors:

+-ExecStartPre=touch /run/lock/bluez/obexd.lock
+-ExecStopPost=rm -f /run/lock/bluez/obexd.lock

That would reduce a missing tmpfile from a crash to just log spam.
But if the tmpfile gains a more important use case in future,
you might uncover bugs in distro's that never installed the tmpfile.

An alternative would be to add a comment like:

+# If the service fails on the following line, please ensure
+# the bluez tmpfile has been installed in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/
+ExecStartPre=touch /run/lock/bluez/obexd.lock
+ExecStopPost=rm -f /run/lock/bluez/obexd.lock

That wouldn't fix the problem, but would make it easier to debug,
and hopefully nudge users to file a useful report with their distro.
