Hi,
I just bought a new BLE HID device which I have a bit of a problem
with. It mostly works but not fully.

The device is an HP Elite Presenter Mouse:
https://www.hp.com/emea_africa-en/products/accessories/product-details/23564275

A pretty neat little device. The one side of it has the typical
presenter buttons for prev/next slide, a center click button and two
more function buttons. When you press and hold the center button the
device switches into a mouse mode and internal gyro/accellerometer is
used to emulate a mouse and move the mouse pointer.

In this presenter mode everything is working, including mouse pointer
movement.

The neat part is that you can twist the device in the middle and with
that flip it over. The other side has two mouse buttons and a touch
area emulating a scroll wheel.

In this mouse mode I can see HCI traffing (hcidump) but no mouse events
in Linux (no movement, no scroll wheel, no mouse button presses).

I am using Debian 'testing' and GNOME desktop on Wayland.

When the device connects I can see the following in dmesg:

[23198.451500] input: HP Elite Presenter Mouse as
/devices/virtual/misc/uhid/0005:03F0:464A.000C/input/input55

'evtest' shows the following input ev devices:

/dev/input/event20:     HP Elite Presenter Mouse
/dev/input/event21:     HP Elite Presenter Keypad

These are the attributes I can query (BT MAC redacted):

And these are some events in this flipped over mouse mode I can
see/dump:

but the mouse pointer does not move, buttons etc. do not work.

I am not sure what the problem could be or how to diagnose this
further. Any hints would be greatly appreciated! Since it seems that
the device works pretty much out of the box in Windows (at least
judging from the manual, I do not have Windows to test) I think no
special drivers etc. should be necessary. So I can just assume that
this devices is special in some way which is not yet fully handled by
BlueZ?

Cheers
