My original patch actually had this MGMT feature called erroneous data
reporting and Marcel argued against it.  If you both agree, then I'm
happy to rename all of this to erroneous data reporting.  We'd still
need some way for the driver support to be messaged some other way
though. see:

if (id->driver_info & BTUSB_WIDEBAND_SPEECH)
        set_bit(HCI_QUIRK_WIDEBAND_SPEECH_SUPPORTED, &hdev->quirks);
