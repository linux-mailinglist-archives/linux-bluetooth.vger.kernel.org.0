Hi Alain,

I left the Set Experimental Feature command flexible and so you could add an extra flags/settings bitmask additionally to choose how to format the debug strings. Similar to what dynamic debug is doing.

An alternative is that you have two debug features, one for with function names and one without. If you turn on both, then the one with function names supersedes.
