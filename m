This is per-adapter and I guess the global one would could exposed on
all adapters since we don't have a global object, or perhaps you are
suggesting to use / for that?

Will add it.

Sure, I do wonder if we should make it writable as well, so
applications can enable/disable experimental features themselves? Or
perhaps that is going too far as to enable unstable code by
application, it would only work when -E is given thought which would
enable everything anyway but I was thinking on having -E optionally
take a list of UUIDs so one could enable just certain features
instead.
