I think a better idea would be that we introduce something specific to
that, such as the SEID being returned so the next time around you may
restore a SEID, this may actually make more sense perhaps if we reuse
the RegisterApplication semantics:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc/gatt-api.txt#n4=
64

That means it is no longer required to call RegisterEndpoint as many
times as there are endpoints since that is time-consuming due to the
D-Bus round trips, instead, the endpoint are discovered with the use
of ObjectManager, if the method doesn't exist then you just fall back
to the old mechanism since it might be an old daemon.
