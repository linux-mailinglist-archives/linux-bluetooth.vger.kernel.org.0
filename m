Was bluetoothd running when you test?
If then, try to run without running the bluetooth daemon and check to see if you have a same
problem.

If you have to use the daemon, change the "AutoEnable" flag in the /etc/bluetooth/main.conf to false
and restart the bluetooth daemon. This will prevent the HCI interface from powering on after cloing
socket.
