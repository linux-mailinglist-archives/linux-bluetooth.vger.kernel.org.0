For the third time, wrap your replies at 72 cols.

I've reflown your reply below manually again, but you need to fix mail
setup and habits so you can communicate with upstream using the mailing
lists.

That's irrelevant.

That's an existing interface, that's ABI and has clearly defined
semantics, unlike what you are proposing.

Those protocol values can never change once they've been added.

No, because the protocol values will never change, unlike the random
data you're shuffling into the driver.

I understand why you want this. I still think it's the wrong approach
and in any case the interface in it's current form is not acceptable.

That's not how Linux works, sorry. We never break user space so your
type data would have to be well-defined and can never change (you can
only add new types).

Also irrelevant. You still don't get to add random new ioctl() that
violates the Linux ABI contract.

No, it's a quick and dirty hack.

I'm sure that can be managed. You claim that these device have a common
protocol (qca) so it should be possible to probe for such differences.

There's no risk as hardly anyone uses the line discipline interface
anymore and it can currently only be used for the old ROME devices.
Just make sure ROME still works after your change.

Probing the device type should result in a better user experience, which
I'm sure your customers will appreciate.
