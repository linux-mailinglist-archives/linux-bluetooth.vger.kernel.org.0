I agree it's cumbersome but given we don't have much data or existing
tests around this, we don't have too many options.  I strongly
disagree with the approach of simply enabling it and seeing what
breaks as scenarios using this functionality are expected to scale out
quickly, likely before we have time to fine all controller issues.

My team is building test infrastructure to help collect data with
this, we already know it's already problematic on a range of
controllers and we have a good idea on which controllers which will be
set.  We will contribute to the cumbersome part of this.
