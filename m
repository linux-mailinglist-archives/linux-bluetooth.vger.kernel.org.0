The presence of PreferredBearer will indicate the device is a
dual-mode, LE+BR/EDR, otherwise you can use the address type to
determine what bearer it is but in that case you only have one bearer
so I don't think it is useful.

I think we would normally try to do cross transport pairing
automatically, if that is not currently happening then perhaps there
is a bug, anyway as part of this exercise we can check how dual-mode
is working and if there is some technical debt like this.

Usually it is quick enough that once you attempt to connect to one
member the other are pick up immediately so I assume this is not
really a problem, well except if there is a problem and the other set
members are not advertising or something, we could in theory bypass
authentication based on other set members in case of just-works method
since we are already doing this when there is a call to Device.Pair
for example (see baafe60d9cbbd9e7939fb6d050d9896731d1ac70).

Hmm, are asking about changing the property would trigger procedures
in case it is already connected? I guess we will need to decide if
that is required, it is not that great to pass errors via reply to a
property change and I'd assume that even if the reconnection fails the
idea is that the new policy persist so I think we would be better off
not attempting to do anything when the property is changed and wait
the user to disconnect, etc, and in that case I wouldn't put anything
at pipewire to attempt to switch the PreferredBearer since this is
sort of out of the Media* interface it probably shall be controlled by
Bluetooth settings rather than audio, Id only recommend messing around
with bearer switch if we ever implement the dual-mode bearer since
then it is just a matter of switching the MediaTransport, but I don't
think headsets realize they could allow dual-mode topology and instead
just restrict the number of stream just as HFP and A2DP cannot be used
simultaneously.
