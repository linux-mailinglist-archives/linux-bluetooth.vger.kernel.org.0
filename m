Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Add features and fix some undesired behaviour of meshctl
Date:   Mon, 18 Nov 2019 14:43:59 +0100

From: Daniele <dbiagio@tiscali.it>

The followings extend the features of meshctl, adding:
 * The Subscription Delete message to the configuration client=20
   (as per Mesh Profile 4.3.2.21)
 * The Generic OnOff Set Unacknowledged message to the onoff
   client model
 * Generic Level Client Model, limited to the following messages:
   - generic level get and set
   - generic level set unacknowledged
   - generic level status
 * Generic Power OnOff Client except the Generic OnPowerUp Set
   Unacknowledged message
They also contains two fixes:
 * The first one cames up when more than a client model is added
   to the local node. The received status messages are forwarded
   to all clients and they needs to be filtered within each client
   in order to avoid wrong reports on the bt shell
 * The second one replaces a return statment within the onoff=20
   client model with a warning message when the user selects an
   unknown target address. For example it happens when the user=20
   tries to send messages to a group address due to the fact that
   such addresses are not stored whitn the json database.
