For your five tests, did it connect on the first boot? As I've said, sometimes it fails to connect on the first boot,
but if it succeeds, it has always failed after a power-off and restart. Looking back at the notes I took during the
bisect, I've didn't have a single bisection step where I had to boot more more than twice to ascertain that it was a bad
kernel. As I said, I didn't mark a kernel as good until I'd had five successful boots.

I don't use pipewire. Prior to 5.17, bluetooth has worked more or less trouble free for at least 4 years. I've read
about pipewire in Linux Magazine but don't see what it would bring to my party except complication.

Did you see the warnings that read "Bluetooth: hci0: unexpected event 0xff length: 5 > 0"? That seems to indicate that
something is sending events that are unexpected. What effect will that have?  As I said, according to lshw, my system's
bluetooth hardware is Intel AX201. Is that what you are testing on?

Sorry, I forgot to answer this question earlier. I haven't changed main.conf. Besides, my bluetooth devices connect
successfully every time with 5.16.11 and 5.15.25 kernels. As I've said before, that strongly suggests that there is a
code regression in 5.17.
