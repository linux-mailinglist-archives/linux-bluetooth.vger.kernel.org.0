We would have to match what is the features that the agent can handle.

We should probably use the mininum version of the client and server,
so if the device supports 1.8 but our agent is 1.5 it should default
to 1.5, this actually would have to be done anyway because othewise we
would make agents duplicating the logic of handling the features
properly so we might as well try to consolidate this on the daemon and
only expose the features that can actually be used in the session,
that means the autoinitilize logic the to take into account both the
device and agent version.
