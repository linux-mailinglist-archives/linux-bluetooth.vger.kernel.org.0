Ha, I was working on that few years back but unfortunatelly it never got in... 
mostly due to objections about dropping old keys before new pairing (which I 
don't think is necessary with proposed Agent consent-based approach but others 
were not sharing my view on this ;-).

Kernel part with reporting proper error to userspace is done so userspace has 
all the information it needs. For bluetoothd I've sent RFC [1] which might 
give you a bit of headstart while working on this. In short, it extends Agent 
API with new call used to consent re-bond of remote device.
