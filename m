I mean we are not really far off actually. The only difference is that currently the tables are in the hci_conn.c file and selected by the provided voice->setting. However nothing really stops us from providing the full table via user space.

Ok. I will look at it and I will try to propose how to extend current
BT_VOICE ioctl API for supporting all those new parameters.

More interesting question would be if alaw codec can be used in
transparent mode by transmitter and in "normal alaw" mode by receiver.
So it is possible to "tell" bluetooth chip "hey, I have already prepared
alaw or CVSD packets for you"?

In Europe all landline phones (and also their SIP non-compressed
equivalents) use alaw codec. So ability to pass SIP alaw samples
directly to headset could increase quality of SIP calls. As currently
received alaw samples are converted to linear PCM, then send to
bluetooth chip which converts it into CVSD codec and finally bluetooth
headset converts CVSD to analog.

So is btintel/btusb already handles it? Or btusb needs to be patches for
"proper" support?
