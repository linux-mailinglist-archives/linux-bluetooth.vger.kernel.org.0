 Marijn, Luiz,

I tested this patch in a use case where bluez acts as a2dp sink and an
andorid phone as a2dp source.
It is working as expected.

I think that we all have correct understanding and only wording is misleadi=
ng.
What I believe Marijn wants to express in this piece of code is that:
AVRCP_GET_CAPABILITIES command can be sent only from the peer acting
as a CT role, but local device capabilities are depending on a2dp
role. It means that if the local device is acting an a2dp sink role in
this specific session it should present capabilities that it actually
can handle as a2dp sink which is only the absolute volume. And if the
local device is acting an a2dp source role in this specific session it
should present capabilities for playback control such as play or
pause. I'm assuming here that the scenario where both devices (local
and peer) are acting both a2dp roles (which means that audio is
flowing in both directions) is not realistic and maybe not even
allowed by the specification.
Maybe renaming target_supported_events and controller_supported_events
names for source_supported_events and sink_supported_events would be
more readable. Because the supported events clearly depend on the a2dp
role of the local device (and on the avrcp version of the peer).

No, where is that written in the specification ? A2DP sink can act
both AVRCP roles.

> It is my understanding that these define what _direction_ events could
> possibly go in.
Yes, "AV Remote (0x110e) and AV Remote Target (0x110c)" define the
direction of the events.
AV Remote (0x110e) is the one that sends commands and receives
notifications and AV Remote Target (0x110c) is the one that receives
commands and sends notifications.

Exactly, for playback control a2dp sink plays the CT role, but for
absolute volume it must play TG role. This is exactly proving that the
a2dp sink role does not force avrcp role. The avrcp role depends on
the action (playback control or volume control).

Another proof for duality of AVRCP roles. For playback control local
device act the CT role, and for absolute volume the local device act
TG role.

If we are in any of the control_handlers (for example in
avrcp_handle_get_capabilities) we for sure are TG (AVRCP target)
because only CT is allowed to send commands. We just don't know if we
are a2dp source or sink.

>if

When we are the audio source we must implement CT role for controlling
the absolute volume, but that does not mean that in
avrcp_handle_get_capabilities we play this role.

>This is in accordance with the logical expectation that
> the sink is in control of the volume.
Yes, but the sink is not the one that is sending SetAbsoluteVolume
commands, it is the source that is sending those commands.

>The target (source) can change
> it by sending SetAbsoluteVolume
No, target cannot send commands.

>, or ask the controller (sink) to

No, target cannot send commands so it cannot register events on controller.

> Not the other way around (what would happen if the sink starts sending
> SetAbsoluteVolume to the source?).
Yes, sink is not supposed to send SetAbsoluteVolume command, but the
source act as a CT role in the context of absolute volume. I guess
that here is the confusion.

We should stick strictly to specification terminology.
1. target/controller are not profiles, they are roles of the AVRCP
profile. So the profile is only one which has two roles.
2. These roles are represented by the services "AV Remote (0x110e)"
and "AV Remote Target (0x110c)" in the service records. So if one
device is including  "AV Remote (0x110e)" service in one of its
service records it means it can act the CT role (but this is not
defining what a2dp role it plays !).
3. source/sink are the roles of the A2DP profile. So there is one A2DP
profile with two roles.
4. client/server - don't use that, there is nothing like that in the
specification.

So bottom line, the way I understand this is that in case when we are
the a2dp sink:
1. if we want to control playback on the a2dp source we must implement
AVRCP CT role for sending playback commands
2, if we want our volume to be controlled by the a2dp source we must
implement AVRCP TG role for receiving commands.

Here we are for sure TG because we are receiving a command. This is
the A2DP role which is unknown and on which our capabilities depends.
But I believe that the code here is exactly doing that, it checks if
we are a2dp source or sink.

supported_events are used only when receiving commands
(get_capabilietes or register_event) and while receiving those
commands we play the TG role. So the peer act as CT so it should
declare AVRCP_REMOTE_UUID(0x110e) service. So only if the peer has
AVRCP_REMOTE_UUID declared supported_events should be initialised. If
we are the a2dp source we should declare that we support playback
control events. If we are a2dp sink we should declare that we support
absolute volume event.
So what I believe Luiz is saying is that both supported_events fields
(target and controller or better name then source and sink) should be
initialized in target_init.
But then we have the problem that peer controller wants to register
absolute volume event before target_init is called.

I think that those supported_events should be statically initialised
separately for a2dp sink and source roles. I cannot understand the
need for checking the peer side avrcp version, is it against the
specification if we declare events that are not supported by the peer
version ? If the peer has avrcp version 1.3 and sends registration
command of absolute volume event then the peer is not consistent with
the specification already.
