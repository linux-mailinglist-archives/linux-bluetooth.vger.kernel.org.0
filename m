This used to be even shorted (2s) and has been bumped to 4s, so I do
wonder if we need to allow the full range, that said userspace can set
its own timeout nowadays:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/src/main.conf#n199

Have you tried doing a #scan off before #connect <bdaddr>? I wonder if
the device is busy discovering, that said bumping to the maximum
window as default sounds like a good idea. @Marcel Holtmann any
thoughts?
