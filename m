I've experienced something similar on my rpi3. I found that on restart,
discover-unprovisioned stopped working.

In my case, it appears that meshd assumes that if there are existing
nodes, scanning has been enabled. Thus, calls from mesh-cfgclient to
discover additional unprovisioned nodes do not need another hci scan
enable at mesh/mesh-io-generic.c:736.

If meshd is restarted with preexisting nodes, scanning is still assumed
to already be enabled, but it's not. This breaks discover-unprovisioned 
for me.

I suspect this is a symptom of a deeper problem where mesh/mesh-config-
json.c:load_node doesn't completely reestablish the node state that
existed when the node was originally added.
