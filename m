Subject: [BlueZ PATCH v5] doc: Describe the new Advertisement Monitor support
Date:   Wed, 29 Apr 2020 20:30:48 -0700
Message-Id: <20200429203031.BlueZ.v5.1.If9f6be992cbaeaa35423de29da6db28675b35fcc@changeid>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.24.1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-bluetooth-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-bluetooth.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-bluetooth@vger.kernel.org

This describes the following commands and event.
- Read Advertisement Monitor Features command
- Add Advertisement Patterns Monitor command
- Remove Advertisement Monitor command
- Advertisement Monitor Added event
- Advertisement Monitor Removed event
Note that the content of a monitor can differ based on its type. For now we
introduce only pattern-based monitor, so you may find that unlike the
command of removing monitor(s), the Add command is tied to a specific type.
---

Changes in v5:
- Add more fields in the return value of Read Advertisement Monitor
Features command.
- Refine the description of commands and events.

Changes in v4:
- In Read Advertisement Monitor Features command, rename
Adopted_Features to Enabled_Features.

Changes in v3:
- Remove Advertisement Monitor can perform the removal of one monitor
or all monitors.
- Add Read Advertisement Monitor Features command.
- Add Advertisement Monitor Added event and dvertisement Monitor Removed
event.

Changes in v2:
- Combine commands to remove one monitor and remove all monitors. The
refined command takes multiple handles and an extra field to indicate
whether to remove all monitors.

+Read Advertisement Monitor Features Command
+===========================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x0049
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:
+	Return Parameters:	Supported_Features (4 octets)
+				Enabled_Features (4 octets)
+				Max_Num_Handles (2 octets)
+				Max_Num_Patterns (1 octet)
+				Num_Handles (2 octets)
+				Handle1 (2 octets)
+				Handle2 (2 octets)
+				...
+
+	This command is used to read the advertisement monitor features
+	supported by the controller and stack. Supported_Features lists all
+	related features supported by the controller while Enabled_Features
+	lists the ones currently used by the kernel.
+
+	Supported_Features and Enabled_Features are bitmasks with currently
+	the following available bits:
+
+		1	Advertisement content monitoring based on Microsoft
+			HCI extension.
+
+	Max_Num_Handles indicates the maximum number of supported
+	advertisement monitors. Note that the actual number of supported
+	ones might be less depending on the limitation of the controller.
+
+	Max_Num_Pattern indicates the maximum number of supported patterns
+	in an advertisement patterns monitor. Note that the actual number
+	of supported ones might be less depending on the limitation of the
+	controller.
+
+	Num_Handles indicates the number of added advertisement monitors,
+	and it is followed by a list of handles.
+
+	This command can be used when the controller is not powered.
+
+
+Add Advertisement Patterns Monitor Command
+=========================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x004A
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Pattern_count (1 Octets)
+				Pattern1 {
+					AD_Data_Type (1 Octet)
+					Offset (1 Octet)
+					Length (1 Octet)
+					Value (variable length)
+				}
+				Pattern2 { }
+				...
+	Return Parameters:	Monitor_Handle (2 Octets)
+
+	This command is used to add an advertisement monitor whose
+	filtering conditions are patterns. The kernel will trigger scanning
+	if there is at least one monitor added. If the controller supports
+	advertisement filtering, the kernel would offload the content
+	filtering to the controller in order to reduce power consumption;
+	otherwise the kernel ignores the content of the monitor. Note that
+	if the there are more than one patterns, OR logic would applied
+	among patterns during filtering. In other words, any advertisement
+	matching at least one pattern in a given monitor would be
+	considered as a match.
+
+	A pattern contains the following fields.
+		AD_Data_Type	Advertising Data Type. The possible values
+				are defined in Core Specification
+				Supplement.
+		Offset		The start index where pattern matching
+				shall be performed with in the AD data.
+		Length		The length of the pattern value in bytes.
+		Value		The value of the pattern in bytes.
+
+	Here is an example of a pattern.
+		{
+			0x16, // Service Data - 16-bit UUID
+			0x02, // Skip the UUID part.
+			0x04,
+			{0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44},
+		}
+
+	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
+	all settings will be programmed once powered.

+Remove Advertisement Monitor Command
+====================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x004B
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Monitor_Handle (2 Octets)
+	Return Parameters:
+
+	This command is used to remove advertisement monitor(s). The kernel
+	would remove the monitor(s) with Monitor_Handle and update the LE
+	scanning.
+
+	When the Monitor_Handle is set to zero, then all previously added
+	handles will be removed.
+
+	Removing a monitor while it is being added will be ignored.
+
+	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
+	all settings will be programmed once powered.
