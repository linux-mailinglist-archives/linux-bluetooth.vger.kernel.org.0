My main objection against endpoint id is that it is less stable then
application dbus path. Endpoint id depends on ordering which is defined
by all application which registers to dbus. And so it does not depend on
application itself. On the other hand endpoint dbus path is fully under
application control, so independently of other applications, dbus path
can be stable -- if application make it stable.
