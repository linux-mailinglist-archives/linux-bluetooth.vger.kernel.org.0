Thank you for trying to bisect the issue. Too bad, it’s inconclusive. 
Did you or can you please test the commits below, relating to the merges 
of the Bluetooth trees.

Having the regression documented is the most important thing, and it 
will be taken seriously even if the reporter has not fully analyzed or
