Hi Luiz,

Because Olivier has been and still is being swamped with other work, I'm 
kind of trying to take over these patches. So far I can reproduce the 
memleak on a recent kernel without the patches.

Olivier told me you added tests to check for the memleak in 
l2cap-tester. Can you point me towards more info on how exactly you run 
these tests, as the info I find on the web is rather minimal.

 From what I read in the thread, it looks like your tests don't catch 
the memleak?

Kind regards,

Marleen
