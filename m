You are saying that the controller would interleave ADV_IND of
different peers before SCAN_RSP, in that case yes that would be
possible that the device would be marked as NOT_CONNECTABLE, usually
that is not really the case which is why we end up adding the code
above:

     * In the really unlikely case that a controller get confused
     * and just sends a scan response event, then it is marked as
     * not connectable as well.

I guess it is not really unlikely after all, so perhaps we need a flag
indicating this is a standalone SCAN_RSP e.g. MGMT_DEV_FOUND_SCAN_RSP,
then we can treat it accordingly in userspace.
