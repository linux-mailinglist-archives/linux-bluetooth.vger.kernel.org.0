Let's say you want to use a KEY_* definition that was recently added to
the kernel, what would you do?

You're talking about the state of things now, I'm talking about the
compilation failures once you rely on a slightly newer header that
isn't shipped with a distribution.

But if you're willing to react to the compilation failure in the
future, I can't really stand in your way. It just seems weird to do
this now just to undo it the moment you'll need a slightly newer kernel
header.

Cheers
