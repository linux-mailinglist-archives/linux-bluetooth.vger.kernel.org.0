Hi Luiz,

There is a UI example of nRF Connect which shows the "Service Changed
Indication" is under "Generic
Attribute"(http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/357737/). We're
using BlueZ 5.48. I tried to add it by modifying example-gatt-server:


class ServiceChangedChrc(Characteristic):
    SCI_UUID =3D '00002a05-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb'

    def __init__(self, bus, index, service):
        Characteristic.__init__(
                self, bus, index,
                self.SCI_UUID,
                ['indicate'],
                service)

    def IndicateValue(self, options):
        # This function doesn't exist. Just list it here.
        pass


class ServiceChangedService(Service):
    MY_UUID =3D '00001801-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb'

    def __init__(self, bus, index):
        Service.__init__(self, bus, index, self.MY_UUID, True)
        self.add_characteristic(ServiceChangedChrc(bus, 0, self))


class Application(dbus.service.Object):
    """
    org.bluez.GattApplication1 interface implementation
    """
    def __init__(self, bus):
        self.path =3D '/'
        self.services =3D []
        dbus.service.Object.__init__(self, bus, self.path)
        self.add_service(HeartRateService(bus, 0))
        self.add_service(BatteryService(bus, 1))
        self.add_service(TestService(bus, 2))
        self.add_service(ServiceChangedService(bus, 3))


When I run it, there is "Failed to register application:
org.bluez.Error.Failed: Failed to create entry in database". That is
in the function client_ready_cb() in gatt-database.c in BlueZ code. Do
you know how to fix it?

Thanks!
Kenny

there is no "service changed indication". The app can't handle the changed =

rature UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received the request =
to read the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device name" is return=
ed to the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavior as the =
bluetooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/bluetooth/[BT_MA=
C]/cache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files in the fo=
lder. That means the disabled cache seems working.
