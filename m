Also can we solve this problem in bluez ASAP? Last released bluez
version is due to that non-experimental API broken and once applications
(e.g. pulseaudio) starts using this new API then A2DP without bluetoothd
-E would be broken.

I would propose to remove experimental mark for codec switching API and
release a new bugfix version of bluez, so people would not use released
5.51 broken version... which could prevent breakage of A2DP in future.
