That said, while the device may be non-compliant, the device is on the mark=
et and I doubt I could get them to update the firmware as a random third pa=
rty. It works on Windows, so clearly Windows doesn't have a problem with it=
s noncompliance. So this raises the question, how should Linux handle non-c=
ompliant hardware, especially when it could easily be made to work just by =
bending the rules in this one instance? I can absolutely change the commit =
message since it's erroneous, but the question then comes down to how shoul=
d it be handled at all.

n that BlueZ, upon expanding the maximum size, does successfully read the o=
verly-long report map (it does use the read blob with offset message to get=
 the last several bytes), it does work as intended if we ignore that specif=
ic rule. Though obviously that's up to the bluetooth maintainers to solve, =
so at this point I'm just tossing my two cents at it.

Are you still planning to update this change? Btw, how about Android,
does it handle such devices?
