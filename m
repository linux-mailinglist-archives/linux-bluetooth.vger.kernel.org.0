[alain] OK, I'm willing to accept this as a rare enough occasion to
avoid making this change, will revert.

[alain] Ok, I can accept this in this case since there isn't any
functional differences or particular risk with the increased scope of
the variable.  I may have a stronger opinion about this in other
conditions.

[alain] This trust relationship between kernel and user is new to me I
have to admit.  I've been trained to never trust the user space from
kernel.  In this case a badly written (or malicious) user space,
willingly or not (if it has its own vulnerability) could cause this
mgmt interface to allocate all the kernel space memory.  If you are
saying this isn't a trust boundary, I'm ok with reverting, else, I may
have more concerns that this trust boundary needs a thorough review?

[alain] Consistency with basebands makes sense in theory, but I
wouldn't limit the functionality of one because of a protocol
limitation of the other.  If something can be improved over LE, I
believe it should.

[alain] Optimizing for storage makes sense (for when address
resolution if offloaded :)) . I'll add the block there as well.
