Well not really, you can still use the object manager style the only
difference is that you will register on a per-device basis instead of
per adapter, not every device is going to have battery providers but
some can have multiple providers from different profiles, but I guess
you were suggesting that one could register a single time per adapter
so we don't have round trips of registration per device in which case
then I would prefer to just have a property indicating the device
object path, but note that if there are different entities handling
different profiles each would have to register individually anyway.
