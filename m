But we do not know default values for future versions which have not
been released yet. There would be a problem if user run current
bluez daemon e.g. in 5 years when new version of HFP profile would be
released and remote device would use it.

Autoinitialized for which version? Bluez has currently defined default
values for HFP 1.7. But DBus agent can register HFP profile also for
version 1.5 or also 1.8.

To which value should it be autoinitialized when remote device announce
that is in version 1.8 but does not specify features (= default for
version 1.8 should be used)? The only option which make sense is to not
autoinitiaze this value as version 1.8 was not released yet and now we
do not know what would be the default value.
