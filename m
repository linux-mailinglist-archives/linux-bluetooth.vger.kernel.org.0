I just noticed the inconsistency here while trying to implement
writeValueWithResponse() and writeValueWithoutResponse() in the Web
Bluetooth API for the Chromium browser and thought that it should
probably all be one way or the other.

FWIW, in the particular case I am working with, the device has both
the WRITE and WRITE_WITHOUT_RESP properties set so I am using "type"
to force writing without response since write with response would
be selected otherwise.

I will send a proper patch to fix the write without response case.
