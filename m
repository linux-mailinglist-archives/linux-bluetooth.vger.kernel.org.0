Hi,

Any comments on this?

We have thought about how to fix it in client side, that is registering 
HFP AG or HSP AG profile with `AutoConnect` disabled and let PipeWire to 
initiate  headset profile connection throw 
`org.bluez.Device1.ConnectProfile(string uuid).

But for headset has no A2DP support, PipeWire is not possible to get 
triggered with device connection event when other application is calling 
`org.bluez.Device1.Connect()` if `AutoConnect` is disabled on HSP AG and 
HFP AG profiles, so that PipeWire don't know when to initiate headset 
profile connection.

Currently we disabled HSP AG by default on PipeWire to work around this 
problem.

Regards,
Bao.
