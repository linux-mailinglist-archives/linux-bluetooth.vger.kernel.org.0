So you prefer to risk getting a kernel crash due to UAF over Bluetooth
not working? Really? Because I haven't seen any configuration that
those changes you tested don't reintroduce the UAF, which is why I
haven't applied that change to begin with, so no I'm not holding back
to pressure Qualcomm to redesign the shutdown logic, it just these
things got entangled because I just realized the shutdown thingy is
really out of place, imo, but I'd be fine if there is a temporary fix
until someone finally decide to spend some time to really fix the
shutdown logic.
