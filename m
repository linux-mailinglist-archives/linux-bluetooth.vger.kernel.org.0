Hi Brian,

Thanks for the quick reply.

I've been working on a mesh stack implementation since June, 
so I have a pretty good understanding of the protocol.

I started the development using a now defunct Linux meshd 
project that used PB-ADV for provisioning. It never had much 
mesh support beyond provisioning.

Later, I moved to meshctl after I implemented Mesh 
Provisioning and Mesh Proxy over GATT.

More recently I've been using various silicon vendor Android 
based mesh apps, which all use GATT exclusively.

At the moment, I'm working on the LPN and Friend support.

OK. I'm currently using bluez-5.50 on some rapberry-pi zero 
w unis with in a Yocto build. I use one pi to run meshctl.

Obviously, bluez has changed since I started. :-)

I cloned the tip and have poked around a bit. However, I 
don't see any OnOff model work other than the 
tools/mesh-gatt/onoff-model.c, which does not *appear* to be 
a part of the mesh-cfgclient build.

I'm probably missing something.
How is this supported in mesh-cfgclient?
