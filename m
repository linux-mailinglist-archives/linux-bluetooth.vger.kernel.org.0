Hi all,

Reviving this thread to talk about how we should handle "set wake
capable".  For a more general implementation, we could rename this to
"Set Connection Params". It could be extended for other connection
parameters in the future.

i.e.
enum conn_params_type {
  SET_WAKE_CAPABLE,
};

struct conn_param {
  uint8_t type;
  uint8_t value;
};

struct set_conn_params {
  bdaddr_t addr;
  uint8_t count;
  struct conn_param values[];
};

Thoughts?

Abhishek
