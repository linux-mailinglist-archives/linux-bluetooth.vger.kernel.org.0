Regarding endpoints yes, it is the endpoint information that has been
exposed via D-Bus objects.

It is not related to avinfo, it was gatttool if you are curious about
it, but most if not all our tools do tend to leak memory when they are
exiting which would trigger some analyzer, etc, to have pointless
reports about those leaks.

Well if the issue is at the negotiation it avinfo is not the useful,
btmon traces are what I usually recommend having as you can figure out
what issues are 99% of the time.

It is not a qualifiable implementation that is for sure, so
classifying it as a testing tool is the best we can do.
