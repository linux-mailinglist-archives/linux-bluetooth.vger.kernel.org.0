Hi Krzysztof,bartosz,

let me summarize our discussion here in order to reduce unneccessary
disagreements here.

1) i only revert your change IS_ERR() to my change IS_ERR_OR_NULL.

2) your change will cause serious regression issues for many lunched
products

3) we only need to discuss how to handle devm_gpiod_get_optional(...,
"enable", ...) returning NULL since this is only difference between your
change and mine.

4) your change doesn't solve any actual issue and the reason you
submitted is that "The optional variants for the gpiod_get() family of
functions return NULL if the GPIO in question is not associated with
this device, and should not treat it as error".

code applet of your merged change is shown by below link
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/bluetooth/patch/20240208164017.26699-1-brgl@bgdev.pl/#25705104

qcadev->bt_en = devm_gpiod_get_optional(&serdev->dev, "enable",
 					       GPIOD_OUT_LOW);
-		if (IS_ERR_OR_NULL(qcadev->bt_en)) {
+		if (IS_ERR(qcadev->bt_en)) {
 			dev_warn(&serdev->dev, "failed to acquire enable gpio\n");
 			power_ctrl_enabled = false;
 		}

5) Original BT driver design agree with your point mentioned at 4), so
for case "qcadev->bt_en == nullptr", qca_serdev_probe() don't do error
return for this scenario and use dev_warn() instead of dev_err() to give
user prompt.

6) your wrong fix changes flag power_ctrl_enabled set logic and will
cause serious BT regression issue, hope you will realize this point.


i would like to give below extra comments even if these comments are
irrelevant to the critical point of this issue mentioned at above 3)

A) you need to investigate it is a) the prompting approach or message
 error or b) the if condition error even if if dev_err() is used to give
prompt instead of dev_warn() in above 4).

B) don't talk about how about devm_gpiod_get_optional() returning error
case since it is meaningless as explained by above 3). also don't
require a fix to fix another unreported issue. a fix is a good fix
if it fix the issue in question and don't introduce new issue.

C) per DTS property enable-gpios of BT, different soc types have
different requirements, many are required and another many are NOT
mandatory as shown be below link.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/bluetooth/qualcomm-bluetooth.yaml.

for a soc type which are attached to 3rd platform, customer doesn't
would like to or are not able to congfig BT reset pin within DTS for QCA
driver even if QC strongly suggest customer config it and also be marked
as required within above DTS bindings spec link. i often meet this
scenario. there are many of such lunched products.

i will try to fix this issue due your change product by product in new
patch thread based on this DTS comment.

D) you maybe ping me offline about this issue if you are a member of QC
since you known "go/upstream"
