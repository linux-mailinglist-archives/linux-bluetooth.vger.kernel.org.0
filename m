Had a go at that this evening as a proof-of-concept; so far it's working
well, so this could be viable. I'll finish it off and test it out properly.

I was able to get the plugin working based on the btd_service state cb,
but had a couple of concerns with it, mainly because we'll be receiving
events for all services on all devices, so the filtering of unused
events adds a bit of overhead.
I was also able to use the AVCTP state callback without issue, which may
be better suited than the AVDTP one.

While the plugin is Bose specific, I had tried to keep the interface
itself generic so that integration with the DE or similar won't need any
changes if ANC support is added for other devices later.
