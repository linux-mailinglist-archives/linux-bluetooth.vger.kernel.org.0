  shared/bass: Make bt_bcast_src private

The bt_bcast_src structure holds information for the BASS Broadcast Audio
Receive State characteristic. This commit makes this structure private
for shared/bass, since this is the only place where GATT characteristics
should be handled.

  shared/bass: Add support to register cp handlers

The BASS Broadcast Audio Scan Control Point characteristic defines a
number of commands that require the BASS Server to sync to Broadcasters.
This should be handled inside the BASS plugin.

This commit adds shared/bass APIs to register control point handlers
with bt_bass. The BASS plugin will use these APIs to register a control
point callback to handle each operation based on opcode and parameters.

  bap: Add support for long-lived PA sync

This adds BAP support for long-lived PA sync.

A BAP Broadcast Sink might probe Broadcasters autonomoulsy (by performing
short-lived PA sync to parse the BASE and discover streams), or it might
act as a Scan Delegator, probing Broadcasters added by a Broadcast
Assistant. If the Assistant requested the Delegator to establish PA sync
with a Broadcaster, the PA sync should be long-lived (it should remain
active until requested otherwise by the Assistant).

  bap: Add API for Scan Delegator probe

Since a BAP Broadcast Sink might probe Broadcasters autonomously or with
the help of a Broadcast Assistant, BAP needs to support 2 types of
Broadcaster probing: short-lived and long-lived.

This adds a BAP API for Scan Delegators probe Broadcaster devices
long-lived.

  bass: Register cp handler for Add Source cmd

This registers a control point handler with shared/bass, for each
eastablished BASS session. For now, only the Add Source opcode is
handled.

Using the parameters provided from shared/bass, a device
is created for the Broadcaster address. The device is then
probed with BAP, where long-lived PA sync will be established.
After parsing the BASE, transports are created for each BIS,
as if the Broadcast Sink scanned the Broadacaster autonomously.

Below is a bluetoothctl log which shows a Scan Delegator starting
to advertise, connecting to a Broadcast Assistant, receiving the
Add Source command for a Broadcaster streaming one BIS, creating
a device for the Broadcaster and then creating a transport for
the BIS:

opcode, which was received from the Broadcast Assistant. It also
shows the long-lived PA sync performed by BAP:

  bass: Add APIs to probe/remove Broadcasters

This adds BASS APIs to probe/remove Broadcasters probed by BAP.

The BAP plugin might probe Broadcasters that were either scanned
autonomously, or that were added by a Broadcast Assistant through
BASS.

After performing long-lived PA sync with a Broadcaster added by a
Broadcast Assistant, the BAP plugin will call the BASS probe API,
to inform BASS that PA has been established with the Broadcast Source
and to provide a reference to the created bt_bap session. Once a
Broadcaster has been probed, BASS will update the PA sync state inside
the corresponding Broadcast Receive State characteristic and
the peer Broadcast Assistant will be notified about the update.

Once the BAP session with a Broadcaster is deleted, the BASS remove
API will be called, to inform BASS that the Source is no longer active.
The BASS plugin will update the PA sync field of the corresponding
Broadcast Receive State characteristic and it will notify the peer
Broadcast Assistant that PA sync is no longer established with the
Source.

  shared/bass: Add APIs to set/clear BIS sync bits

This adds shared/bass APIs to set/clear bits inside the BIS sync bitmask
of Broadcast Receive State characteristics. Notifications are sent to the
peers each time the characteristic is updated.

  bass: Register BAP state changed cb

This registers a BAP stream state changed callback inside BASS, to monitor
the state of BAP streams created by the Scan Delegator and to notify
the peer Broadcast Assistants about updates.

The bluetoothctl log below shows a Scan Delegator creating a media
transport for a BIS added by a Broadcast Assistant through the
Add Source operation. The transport is then acquired and then
released:

  shared/bass: Add API to check BIS required for sync

This adds a shared/bass API to check if a BIS index of a Broadcast Source
has been requested by the Broadcast Assistant to be synced with. This will
be used by BAP after parsing the BASE, to filter out the streams that don't
need to be created.

  bap: Create streams for required BISes

If a BAP Broadcast Sink is acting as a Scan Delegator and it has performed
long-lived PA sync with a Broadcaster added by a Broadcast Assistant, the
BASE should be parsed and streams need to be created only for BISes
requested by the Assistant.

This adds a BASS check inside parse_base, to filter out BISes that do not
require streams.

The bluetoothctl log below shows a Scan Delegator registering a Broadcast
Sink PAC and connecting to a Broadcast Assistant:

client/bluetoothctl

The btmon log shows the Scan Delegator receiving the Add Source command
from a Broadcast Assistant, requesting to sync to BIS index 2 of the
provided Broadcaster. After PA sync, the BASE shows that the Broadcaster
is streaming 2 BISes, both matching the audio capabilities supported by
the Scan Delegator:

Only one transport will be created, for BIS index 2, since it was
the only one requested in the Add Source command:
