Not sure I follow these arguments, it seems AllowInternalProfiles may
actually enable hijacking the profiles so I wonder if you got this
backwards as we can't let things like HoG be controlled by
applications directly it would be too easy to implement something like
a keylogger, or perhaps you are suggesting that there is another layer
for implementing the profiles? Note that it is intended that plugins
shall be used for profiles that need to be integrated system wide,
D-Bus interface shall be restricted to only application specific
profiles.

Note that we do allow external profiles to be registered with use of:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc/profile-api.txt

And for GATT:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc/gatt-api.txt#n366

We could perhaps make the assumption that once an application
registers itself as supporting a given profile we check if against a
blacklist of profiles that may have security implications, which
perhaps could be defined via main.conf or some other file, if that is
not the case the internal profile can be disabled and the D-Bus object
would be accessible over D-Bus. Also note that we do offer clients the
ability to have exclusive access with AcquireWrite and AcquireNotify.
