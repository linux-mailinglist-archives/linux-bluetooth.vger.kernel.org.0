All userspace hsp/hfp implementations have packet loss concealment, I 
think, so they can tolerate losing one or two packets there and there. 
In any case it is much more usable than before. Without this patch, the 
number of packet lost is in the 10-1000 range and it is much harder to 
conceal that.

With this patch, given this sequence 01230123, if the first fragment (0) 
is lost, then only one packet is lost. If anything else than the first 
fragment, say (2) is lost, then 0130 is forwarded to the upper layer and 
  the remaining 123 is dropped.

With my ath3k I see that dropped fragments are replaced by zero-length 
fragments. I have a patch that treats zero-length fragments as an error 
and drops the current packet when it occurs, but I can't be certain that 
this won't cause any regression for other adapters, so didn't submit it.

Will move that into btusb.c then.
