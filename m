fair enough. Now the question is if we might want to split between controller defaults and host defaults.

My OCD wants to do that as well, but my experience has been that this never actually works out. And we will have parameters that apply to both transports. Like for example the minimum encryption key size.

Now we might actually better split this into a command for system default parameters and one for runtime default parameters. I think it would make the code a lot simpler since we can have clear error codes. Thoughts?
