I think you found a regression. Calling close() on the HCI User Channel should bring the device back down. This used to work correctly, can you please bisect which kernel patch broke this.

Back in the days I added tools/userchan-tester, but it seems I never included enough test cases to catch this regression.

Regards

Marcel
