Subject: security@bluez.org doesn't work

I've spent two weeks trying to report a bug in bluez that may have security
implications, with no evidence of success.  The details of the issue aren't
relevant to the problem, so I'll just say I'm not a security professional
and can't say for certain whether the bug is actually a security problem.

https://www.bluez.org/development/ has a section "security bugs" with a link
labelled "handling the security bug of BlueZ".

That link points to https://www.bluez.org/development/security-bugs/,
which says "The BlueZ security team can be contacted by email at
security@bluez.org".

I sent an e-mail to security@bluez.org on 2025-03-26, and got an 
automatic reply
on 2025-03-31 saying the message couldn't be delivered:

Note: I have replaced the actual address with "(address hidden)" above,
as I'm not sure whether this address was supposed to be made public.

So far as I can tell, the message above means mail.holtmann.org is 
attempting
to send e-mails claiming to be from my domain, and correctly being blocked
by Google because I haven't authorised it to do so.

I then sent the bug report and the above issue directly to the hidden 
address
on 2025-04-03, but have not yet received a reply.

Could you let me know the correct process to report security issues and how
long I should expect to wait before acknowledgement?  Also, can you put
that information on the website for the next person who comes along?
