I would assume the users would expect that this would trigger pairing
procedure since silently ignoring the change would make this go
completely unnoticed.

This gets a bit tricky since the HOGP mandates security but HIDS does not:

Security Permissions of =E2=80=9CNone=E2=80=9D means that this service does=
 not impose
any requirements.

So my understanding is that a peripheral implementing HIDS does _not_
require bonding and to make matters more confusing none of the
attributes requires security etiher which is perhaps the very reason
HOGP mandates bonding, also afaik peripherals are not mandate to
initiate pairing procedures so it looks like peripherals can in fact
not require bonding and still be compliant.
