This one is related to IRK resolution. In the existing kernel code
when configuring the le passive scan, if there are any addresses in
the whitelist which also have an IRK stored, the whitelist filter
policy is 0.

Yes, we could let the kernel inform bluetooth that suspend is about to
occur (maybe via PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE) and wait for bluez to finish the
suspend tasks before continuing. We could probably do this via event
pairs of SUSPEND_PREPARE/SUSPEND_PREPARE_DONE and
RESUME_PREPARE/RESUME_PREPARE_DONE.

 that list first. Right now we don=E2=80=99t really do that. And I think we=
 don=E2=80=99t have an easy way to tell the kernel via mgmt what this list =
will be.

We will want to introduce a new mgmt op or update an existing op to
set a wake capable bit for the device. MGMT_OP_SET_CONN_PARAMS might
be a good candidate to update with this info.
As for how bluez holds this information, I think we mark all devices
that create uhid or uinput as wake capable and then disable them if we
don't want them to wake us up. Maybe a "WakeSource" property in the
device properties?

In most cases because you want to pair with it. The way how mgmt works is t=
hat we discovery only for a period of time. And bluetoothd turns it into a =
continuous discovery as long as a specific UI portion is open and requestin=
g it. Unless discovery has a different meaning, then a simple restart is en=
ough.

The use-case I'm thinking of is the user has the scanning window open
and then closes the lid of their laptop. Right before suspend, they
were Discovering but in order to suspend, we need to stop. I think
maybe pause and unpause are ambiguous; it is actually just stop
discovery and start discovery.

Yes, I think we do. While we could initially leave this out, if we
wanted policy based wakeup control, we would need this.

I think when we upstream this, we would want to do it this way
(especially because I don't think there's a userspace power manager
that's common across distros). I will look into using the PM notifiers
further.
