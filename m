Yep, it is quite possible others OSes don't take advantage of big
UUIDs like we do since we can discover more than one service at time
that speeds up the discovery procedure quite a lot depending on MTU
size.

We should at least attempt to validate the response since it appears
we don't detect there is more data than expected but if the total
length is actually a multiple of the elements len it would still
create invalid attributes in the database. Anyway I would reach to the
manufacturer since they are clearly not following the Bluetooth Core
spec to the letter here.
