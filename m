So do I.

If we really need to avoid two separate methods, I think it would be a
bit cleaner to pass this parameter as a D-Bus variant of (u16,
array[16]) instead of a dictionary.

Still, even if we add a method, the application is free *not* to
implement it, since we agreed back in the day that calls to
MessageReceived do not require a response, so any errors would be simply
ignored by the daemon.

I am very much against adding any kind of traslation here. I think that
maintaining subscription IDs would only complicate things, with no
additional benefit. I think it would also confuse users, as there is no
such thing as 'subscription id' in the spec. Mesh is already complex as
it is.

Indeed, and we also have two options here:
 - if we decide to provide two MessageReceived methods, I would go with separate
   keys
 - if we go with the variant approach proposed above, I would also
   return an array of variants here
