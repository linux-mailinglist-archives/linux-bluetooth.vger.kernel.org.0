  bap: do not try QoS before links are updated & io created

In setup config, QoS must be done after corresponding bap_state
callback, because stream links are updated only at that point.  If the
ASE was in CONFIG state before reconfiguration, this gets done in wrong
order.

Track explicitly that bap_state() is done after bt_bap_stream_config(),
before proceeding to QoS.

  shared/bap: detach ucast io on RELEASING and unlink streams

When RELEASING, ucast stream QoS becomes invalid and client stream
transport can no longer be acquired.  Client shall close the CIS when
ASE is RELEASING (BAP v1.0.2 =C2=A75.6.6).

As client, detach IO when RELEASING. Clear the stream links, as the QoS
is no longer valid. Even if caching config the ASE may be reused for
different purpose, and stream will anyway be reconfigured & re-linked as
needed.

Also clear the stream transport, as it's not in acquirable state, and
its configuration may change after this. This makes BAP Client to have
existing transports only for streams that are >=3D QOS.  (BAP Server is
not changed here.)

  shared/bap: add client ASE reuse and upper level stream locking

Change ucast client stream design so that:

* upper level locks streams to indicate which ones it is using
* unused streams are reused when upper level wants a new stream
* only locked streams are used for bidi CIS linking
* streams (still) correspond 1-to-1 to non-idle ASEs

This fixes some issues:

* bap_ucast_stream_new() could pick a stream upper level is already
  using if lpac & rpac match (can occur with multi-stream AC 6(ii) etc)
* Avoids assuming ASE enters idle state at end of stream life cycle.
  This is False for some devices like Sony headsets, which always cache
  codec config so RELEASING -> CONFIG always, never RELEASING -> IDLE,
  so ASE never go IDLE again.
* Allows reconfiguring an ASE with different codec in this case.
* Allows upper level to only QoS some of the streams.

Reconfiguring ASE in QOS/CONFIG state with different codec here results
to need_reconfig=3Dtrue state, where ASE and stream configs do not match,=

and upper level needs to do bt_bap_stream_config() to sync them.

When setup is freed, make sure the corresponding stream is released
after unlocking.

Operations like SetConfiguration need to wait until setup configuration

completion or failure, instead of hardcoding DBus reply.

Add Reconfigure() on a BAP unicast endpoint, which triggers its

First, all associated streams are closed. After that, endpoints marked
for reconfiguration are reconfigured using the same flow as in the
initial configuration.

  bap: delay QoS & IO creation if CIG is busy or setups configuring

Unicast Client IO creation / activation should be done synchronously for
whole adapter, as active CIG has to be removed before it can be
reconfigured (Core v6.0 Sec 4.5.14.3).  Some adapters support only one
active CIG.

Move related logic to bap_update_cig*() which does QoS and IO creation
as needed by current state.

If CIG is active or setups are being configured or closed, delay
transitions to QoS and IO recreation until that completes.  Also delay
activating CIG (=3D enabling CIS) until setups have finished readying or
closing.

Operations are delayed within the same CIG, with the exception that
streams with unassigned CIG delay every CIG. This is because such
streams are likely meant to go to some existing CIG, so we must wait
them to be configurable before asking kernel to assign IDs.

Fixes race conditions:

* setup starts readying while CIG is active
* CIG is activated while a setup is readying
* new stream creates IO before old stream IO is recreated

These result to kernel assigning new streams to a different CIG
(problematic on controllers that can do only one) or CIS ID conflicts.
