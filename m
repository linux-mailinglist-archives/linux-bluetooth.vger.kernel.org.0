In general, I agree that HFP/HSP AT protocol handling is something that
the audio daemons should not have to worry about. However, I am
concerned with the level of fragmentation that exists in the bluetooth
stack.

At the moment, the best case scenario is that we have 2 processes
involved in bluetooth audio (in the case where we route directly to/from
the speakers & microphone of the linux host in question):

  bluez5 <-> pulseaudio

With pipewire & bluez-alsa, we have 3 processes:

  bluez5 <-> pipewire bluetooth session <-> pipewire daemon

  bluez5 <-> bluez-alsa <-> alsa application

The 3 process separation here happens so that the bluetooth codecs run
in the process that sits in the middle. This avoids having to care about
codecs on the right side and also avoids slowing down the pipewire
daemon (so that it can still do low-latency audio processing)

When ofono comes into play, we increase this by 1:

   bluez5 <-> ofono <-> pulseaudio

  bluez5 <-> ofono <-> pipewire bluetooth session <-> pipewire daemon

  bluez5 <-> ofono <-> bluez-alsa <-> alsa application

With your proposal, we have one more:

   bluez5 <-> hfphspd <-> ofono <-> pulseaudio

  bluez5 <-> hfphspd <-> ofono <-> pipewire bluetooth session <->
pipewire daemon

  bluez5 <-> hfphspd <-> ofono <-> bluez-alsa <-> alsa application

And it can become even more crazy when you do ugly hacks like what I
have done in Automotive Grade Linux, where I use bluez-alsa for its
codec implementation & HFP/HSP handling, and then route the audio using
a gstreamer-based helper process to the pipewire daemon process
(temporarily, to workaround issues in the pipewire native implementation):

  bluez5 <-> hfphspd <-> ofono <-> bluez-alsa <-> gstreamer helper <->
pipewire daemon

Instead of all of this crazy context switching, what I would prefer to
see is a standalone component library that someone could combine in a
single process to get things done. This would:

* avoid re-implementing all kinds of stuff over and over in different
audio daemons (we do have 3 implementations atm: pulseaudio, pipewire &
bluez-alsa)
* prevent people like me from doing ugly hacks to get work done
* improve collaboration between all the different people that care about
the bluetooth stack instead of having them antagonize each other
* avoid the context switching overkill; we should only have 1 process
between bluez and the audio daemon / solution, imho
* potentially allow people to use some components in combination with a
proprietary bluetooth stack instead of bluez (a strong requirement in
the automotive industry at the moment, at least)

I imagine that this component library would include:

* bluetooth audio codecs
* HFP/HSP commands handling
* telephony handling
* exposure of common D-Bus APIs for side-channel things like power
management or phone dialing

... and then every downstream user (pulse, pipewire, bluez-alsa, ...)
could reuse these components and implement the rest of the routing /
management logic in their own daemon.

My two cents...

George
