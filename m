But the cache only applies to client, service changed is for the
server not sure why your mobile would be crashing with that, or is it
disabling ServiceChanged indications with that? If there is no
indication that would explain why the services are not updated since
the mobile OS won't notice any changes on the database.

This sounds like ServiceChanged is not being properly propagated when
you do the firmware update, do you have ServiceChanged entry on the
storage:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc/settings-storage.txt#n321

Is there any indication on btmon when you first connect after doing
the firmware update?
