If you are referring to autotest, we are actively introducing new test
cases for both existing D-Bus interfaces and the newly-added
interfaces. In case of Adv monitor API, http://crrev.com/c/2384793 is
currently under review, and we have a test plan which includes
combination tests with suspend/resume, crashes, reconnection,
foreground scanning and functionalities.
