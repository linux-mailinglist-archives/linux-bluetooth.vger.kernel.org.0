Hello:

I've noticed a problem attaching a bluetooth mouse. (or enabling
bluetooth at all)

I have a laptop that I don't depend on, and use for testing, or
playing around.  It's a converted Chromebook, an Acer C710.
In the past, I've used bluetooth, primarily for a mouse.  Converted it
to use the Fedora rawhide branch a while ago, and everything seemed OK.
My use case for it has changed, so it has spent more time plugged into
devices, including a trackball, so I'm not sure exactly when this
change happened.

At some point, the bluetooth mouse stopped working, and I was unable
to turn on the bluetooth adapter on the laptop at all.  I figured that
it was my fault, I had done some questionable removals of packages to
get things to upgrade.  No problem, I'll wipe and reload, and get it
working.

While booting off the Fedora 33 USB drive, no problem, I was able to use the
mouse.  Installed, and booted up the system, same.

After I did a full system upgrade, it is back to not working again.

If I boot from an older kernel  (the 5.8.15 from the install image)  no problem.

If I boot from the 5.10.10 kernel, the bluetooth module does not work.

I've seen the same results with KDE, gnome, and XFCE, so I'm pretty
sure it's not the DE.

I get the following:

dmesg | grep hci0
[  11.031856 ] Bluetooth: hci0: don't support firmware rome 0x11020000

Like the following shows:  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210681


Not sure where else to go from here, wait until the fix is committed
in the kernel?

If a bug report needs to be made, if someone could point me in the
right direction.

Thanks,
  --murph
