Hello, when I run btmon, I see following information very early before
creating A2DP connection:

HCI Event: Read Remote Supported Features (0x0b) plen 11
        Status: Success (0x00)
        Handle: 35
        Features: 0xff 0xff 0x8f 0xfe 0x9b 0xff 0x59 0x87
          ...
          Enhanced Data Rate ACL 2 Mbps mode
          Enhanced Data Rate ACL 3 Mbps mode

I do not need to change MTU size, I would just like to know EDR features
capabilities. Cannot be those information exported somehow from kernel?
I guess that kernel should have these information if it can send it to
btmon.
