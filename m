maybe we should do SupportedTypes = [“le”, “bredr”, “hs”] since that also maps to what we expose in MGMT. And then add a Types = [ .. ] property with the same values. I don’t like using GAP in property names and repeating Device is also not needed since we are already in the Device interface. In addition I have a reservation with spec naming in this area since it has changed over time and there is a chance it might change again in future specs when new features come along.

If you know the supported types of the hardware and the selected types, you can easily get to the GAP Device Type from the spec if you actually want to show it. If you wanted to, you could make the Types property writeable as well and users could change their device type via D-Bus.

Regards

Marcel
