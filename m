This criticism makes a ton of sense. I'm sorry I missed it before. There 
were a lot of threads moving in parallel. However, I am curious. Given 
that the patch improves the situation for users (like me). Is there any 
way we can separate the redesign of the shutdown sequence and the UX 
improvement that comes with this patch?

Here's my concern. I am happy to do the work to redesign this. However, 
I don't think I have the information needed to do this since I don't 
have access to the technical docs for the qca6390. I am worried that not 
accepting some form of this patch is letting perfect be the enemy of the 
good. And I am not sure how I personally can help with that. If you 
think it's possible for me to do this without the docs for the hardware, 
I am willing to give it a shot if I can get some guidance. Honestly, I 
wish I had the skill to be confident about a change like this, but I don't.

Any ideas on how to move forward would be greatly appreciated.

And just to be perfectly clear, I have tested this patch on my laptop. 
It greatly enhances my ability to use my hardware since I can reboot the 
machine without having to make sure to power cycle the laptop. This is 
not a theoretical improvement.

Thanks,
wt
