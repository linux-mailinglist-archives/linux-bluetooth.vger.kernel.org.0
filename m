  pbap: Support calling pbap_init() after pbap_exit()

pbap_exit() didn't previously unregister itself thoroughly.  That
was fine if it was only called when the service was about to exit,
because everything was implicitly unregistered when the process ended.
But we need to be more scrupulous if this can be called throughout
the program's lifecycle.

Send the UnregisterProfile message directly from pbap_exit(),
then call unregister_profile().

The UnregisterProfile message can't be sent directly from
unregister_profile(), because that also needs to be called when
register_profile() fails halfway through.

  obexd/bluetooth: Support calling bluetooth_init() after bluetooth_exit()

was fine if it was only called when the service was about to exit,
because everything was implicitly unregistered when the process ended.
But we need to be more scrupulous if this can be called throughout

Do not free profiles in bluetooth_exit() - profiles are needed
by a future call to bluetooth_init(), or will be freed by
bluetooth_stop() if necessary.

  obexd: Support creating private system/session bus connections

Obexd can either connect to the system or session bus.
We mostly share a common connection to that bus, but it can be useful
to have a private connection.  For example, this allows us to quickly
unregister profiles when switching user.

Add obex_setup_dbus_connection_private(), which creates a new
connection to whichever bus was specified by the user.

  obexd: Unregister profiles when the user is inactive

Obexd is usually run as a user service, and can exhibit surprising
behaviour if two users are logged in at the same time.

Unregister profiles when the user is detected to be off-seat.

It may be impossible to detect whether a user is on-seat in some cases.
For example, a version of obexd compiled with systemd support might be
run outside of a systemd environment.  Warn and leave services
registered if that happens.

Obexd can be run as a system service, in which case this check makes no
sense.  Disable this check when called with `--system-bus`.

Obexd can also be run by a user that does not have an active session.
For example, someone could use `ssh` to access the system.  There might
be a use case where someone needs Bluetooth access but can't log in with
a keyboard, or there might be a security issue with doing so.  This isn't
handled explicitly by this patch, but a future patch could add support
by calling `logind_set(FALSE)` in the same way as is currently done
with `--system-bus`.

Unregister profiles by closing private connections instead of sending
UnregisterProfile on the shared connection.  Pipewire has apparently
found the latter to cause long shutdown delays, because bluetoothd
may be shutting down and unable to handle this message.

Based in large part on the wireplumber code mentioned by Pauli Virtanen:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/blob/master/modules/module-logind.c#L52

Other services are likely to need similar functionality,
so I have created a gist to demonstrate the basic technique:

  obexd: Support sd_login_monitor_get_timeout()

The documentation for sd_login_monitor_get_timeout() implies the API
may need to be checked after some time, even if no events have been
received via the fd.

In practice, the implementation has always returned a dummy value,
and changing it now would cause enough breakage in other projects
to make it unlikely to ever happen.

Add a handler for that case, even though it can't currently
happen in the real world.

The API assumes we call poll() directly, so in theory it could change
the timeout based on some event that doesn't trigger a callback
(e.g. sending a signal to the service).  It's hard to see how we'd
handle that without running a poll() in a separate thread,
which would be a lot of complexity for an untestable edge case.
Don't try to handle that problem.
