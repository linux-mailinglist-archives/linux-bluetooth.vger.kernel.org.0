Yes we do, the version would tell exactly what features the agent can handl=

The version needs to be compatible no matter if the features are
different for AG/HF.

Then 1.8 defaults are used, if the daemon don't support 1.8 then the
agent cannot register for 1.8 to begin with.

Like I said before, bluez controls the SDP record so it will need to
understand what features are supported based on version, this is
exactly why we want the daemon to control the sdp record so we don't
have the agents dealing version compatibility, etc.
