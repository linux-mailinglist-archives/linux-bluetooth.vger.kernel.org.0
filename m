Ack. Will update the doc to suggest UUID in this source field.

It is actually already in ObjectManager style. After the "root path"
is registered, the provider can expose many D-Bus objects at once and
bluetoothd can detect it.
About tying it with the Profile API, I will take a look at how it could be done.

I am okay with naming the interface Battery1, the same as the daemon.
Will make an update.
About the exporting battery status via UHID, it is possible to be
done, but it is an orthogonal problem that we plan to tackle
separately. Right now, this API is general enough for Chrome OS to
allow both HFP and HID batteries to be consolidated in BlueZ. Chrome
OS's powerd feeds only Bluetooth battery levels from
/sys/class/power_supply and filters out USB devices so the UI layer
does not need to worry about it: everything from BlueZ is tied to a
Bluetooth device.
