Yes, it may be more stable but it is also not unique so in the event 2
endpoints happen to have the same path we would have to disambiguate
them somehow and because of that I don't think we should be using
that. Im not sure why this would be a big deal since we should call
SelectConfiguration it is not like we would end up in a situation
where the stream would fail to setup since if that fails we fallback
to the priority ordering, if the user felt something out of order it
was either the system has changed (PA update, etc) or the device has
changed (new firmware, etc).
