Hi Pali,

Since HFP can do everything that HSP can and more, I view HSP as 
deprecated and not to be used.  If these are also available in HFP, then 
I'd just use HFP instead.  But HSP was never my focus, so if you feel 
there's a need for better HSP support, then fair enough.

But that's my point, you can easily accomplish this by creating another 
oFono API / atom for HFP CSR extensions and expose this information / 
functionality.  Similar to how Siri was done.  I see no need for a 
completely new external daemon.

The latter.

See above..

Why not?  The main purpose of HFP is telephony; whether it is classic 
phone calls or skype/facetime.  oFono seems a natural fit.

This statement is not true at all.  You can use oFono without any 'real' 
modems attached.  It can happily manage only HFP devices (or modems as 
we call them.)

>>

You must be thinking of the oFono HFP AG implementation...

>>

Again, not true.  As I said above, you can use oFono for this use case 
just fine.  Certainly the main driver for the development of oFono was 
to drive real modem hardware, but it isn't limited to that.  So if you 
want to use it only for HFP, you can.

Regards,
-Denis
