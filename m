so I do not recall why that has been chosen this way. Does it work any better if you chose a different value. I mean the air codec is transparent and so the input to the PCM interface must be treated transparent as well. Meaning whatever value you have for the other settings doesn’t matter.

However I did check the specs and can’t find any note in that direction. However we are feeding mSBC frames instead of PCM frames in the case of CVSD into the controller. So it should just work with whatever values the voice setting has.

Regards

Marcel
