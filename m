So to summarize.  You have broadly 3 main use cases for HFP:

1. HF connecting to AG role.  Essentially a carkit role.  oFono does 
this pretty well already and has the APIs defined that cover up to HFP 
1.7.  Any vendor extensions can be easily added.  And some carkit 
manufacturers already use it.

2. AG role when you have a 'real modem' behind it.  oFono already 
provides everything needed for this scenario.

3. AG role when you don't have a real modem or you have some sort of 
VoIP use case.  oFono doesn't cover this case as you stated.

So I can see value in something that implements case #3.  But having 
said that, oFono will not be receiving AT commands from external daemons:
	- For case 1, it'd just be a rehash of what oFono does well already.  I 
reinvented a few wheels in my time, but doesn't mean I think this one 
should be.
	- The reasoning for case 2/3 I already covered upthread.

Sure, but that doesn't mean they need an actual D-Bus API to be 
configured with.  You can simply extend oFono emulator to support 
whatever codecs you want and whatever custom AT command handling that 
you need.  If the HF requests the codec, then you use it.  There's no 
D-Bus API required here.  Again, take a look at how this is done in 
oFono today.

There have been one or two implementations of AG role fully external to 
oFono.  These implementations simply used the existing oFono APIs to 
drive the modem.  You could do that.  But as I said, we rejected such a 
design a long time ago due to complexity and other issues.

Or you can ignore the call control aspects entirely...

But in the end, it is your architecture.  All I can do is point out 
(early in the process) what is and what is not acceptable to oFono upstream.

Well it was a bit of reading comprehension fail on my part as well.  The 
two roles are really quite different, so precise language helps.
