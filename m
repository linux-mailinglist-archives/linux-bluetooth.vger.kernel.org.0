Ok, that makes more sense now.

Hmm, I think Ive added it in case the BIG was not created yet but the
socket is terminated then we need to clean up the periodic advertising
set since we don't have a hci_conn yet.

Yeah, I think adding BIS on-demand based on the number of sockets open
is more consistent to how we handle that in case of unicast.
