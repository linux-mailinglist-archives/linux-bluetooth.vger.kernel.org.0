I'm sorry, Kiran, you were 100% right, even the stock kernel hasn't yet
included that patch. After compiling 5.15.2 plus the above mentioned patch,=
 I
can definitively confirm that on my system the issue is completely fixed.
Rebooted 5 times, each time the bluetooth was working correctly. Finally th=
is
bug is fixed, I hope it will be merged soon, at least on the 5.15 series.

Thanks a lot for your work,

Marco.
