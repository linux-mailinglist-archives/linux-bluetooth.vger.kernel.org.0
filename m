You are correct, the EIR response is not a guaranteed thing.  For this
reason, the host should try to resolve the name of the device before
initiating bonding where a Remote Host Supported Feature Notification
Event is generated to signal the remote side's support of SSP.  As you
allude to, a remote spoofing a legitimate SSP device may always just
jam and downgrade to not SSP, but if you have any signals that SSP is
supported by the device, it may be a good defensive posture.
Receiving an EIR response or a Remote Host Supported Feature Event
with the SSP bit set is a good indication that the device supports SSP
and you should expect SSP to take place.  Again, it is not a valid
configuration to have EIR enabled but not SSP per my interpretation of
the 2.1 specification.
