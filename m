Hi there!

I have observed a segfault in bluetoothctl when closing it with Ctrl-D
or with the exit command, be it with or without running any other
commands.

My bluez build is version 5.70, I'm on Void Linux with musl libc, and
this is the segfault backtrace:

#0  0x0000558a92ee2043 in queue_remove_all (queue=<optimized out>, 
function=function@entry=0x0, user_data=user_data@entry=0x0,
     destroy=0x558a92ee7430 <io_destroy>) at src/shared/queue.c:338
         tmp = 0xfffffffefffffffe
         entry = 0xfffffffefffffffe
         count = 0x0

         client = 0x558a948cafe0
         status = 0x0

Running it under valgrind shows that there are UAF issues even before
exiting:
