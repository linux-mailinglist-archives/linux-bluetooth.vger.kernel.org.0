Have a look at the other thread subject: Adding support for
DuplicateData into the kernel

We are discussing adding support to disable duplicate via MGMT since
DuplicateData does not currently remove it but we might want to change
that, or at least have some alternative API to do that. We could for
example have a socket that enables a more direct access to the
advertisments, that way protocol that work over advertisement would
have a way to do this, in fact this might be better for things like
mesh so it can coexist with bluetoothd.
