I was able to successfully perform that same sequence without a
problem. I created an appkey 0 and 1 and added them to my Sylvania
lamp.

[config: Target = 00c5]# appkey-add 0
Received AppKeyStatus
Node 00c5 AppKey status Success
NetKey	000
AppKey	000
[config: Target = 00c5]# appkey-add 1
Received AppKeyStatus
Node 00c5 AppKey status Success
NetKey	000
AppKey	001

I found that my Sylvania lamps arrived mostly broken and wouldn't do
much until their firmware was updated with the Sylvania ios app.

Also, PB-ADV hasn't been super reliable for me. Sometimes, I have to
repeat the command before I get a status response.
