okay, let us stop here now, i would like to summarize here.

1) it is me to co-work with reporter and solved his issue and verified
with PASS results

2) suppose you don't have any negative comments any more about my patch
serials.

3) there are no other working fixes until now when i write this summary

4) i, as a member of BT team of Qualcomm, will give comments about its
QCA BT driver changes as much as possible if i have time.
