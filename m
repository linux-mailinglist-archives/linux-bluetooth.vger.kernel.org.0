No, all in one response (which is re-assembled from two HCI packets).

My working device (DIY, arduino, but probably based on nordic semi code)
does the right thing:
It returns all handles with 16 bit, the client requests a continuation,
which results in the MIDI I/O characteristic, 128Bit, in another response.

Thanks for clarifying. So quite obvious a bug in their (Roland's) 
implementation. I hope they care enough.
I contacted them through their customer support forum, but I don't have 
much hope getting by the first-level support there.
If anybody has a better contact...

In this case, it would help to fetch the characteristics service by 
service instead of all in one. All characteristic UUIDs for the MIDI 
service are 128bit, the rest is all 16 bit. Could be the reason it works 
with Windows, Android, OSX, and whatever else they test with.

 From my limited understandig, that could probably be changed, but needs 
to be done in the general code, slowing everybodys pairing time down. A 
non-starter, I guess, for a single buggy device.

So I'll keep a fork with my super-ugly workaround and hope for roland.
I have to rebuild bluez anyway because my distro does not use 
--enable-midi.

Thanks!
Jo
