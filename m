The issue happens on 8821CE.

The reset is done by the kernel, so how does that affect bluez?

From what you described, it sounds more like runtime resume since bluez is already running.
If we need reset resume for runtime resume, maybe it's another bug which needs to be addressed?

We don't know beforehand if the platform firmware (BIOS for my case) will cut power off or not.

In general, laptops will cut off the USB power during S3.
When AC is plugged, some laptops cuts USB power off and some don't. This also applies to many desktops. Not to mention there can be BIOS options to control USB power under S3/S4/S5...

So we don't know beforehand.

Of course.
I think we need to find the root cause for your case before applying this one.
