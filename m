Access to the MTU has been a highly requested feature in
WebBluetooth[1] with reasonable use cases.

I'm coming at this from the cross-platform point of view. Windows,
Apple and Android don't have an equivalent of AcquireWrite. They have
device-level methods/properties to get the MTU [2][3][4]. So instead
of forcing WebBluetooth to have an API compatible with AcquireWrite
it would be very nice to be able to get the required information
in a different way that is similar to the existing methods on other
platforms.

Maybe there are better alternatives to get the same information?
For example, the Apple API doesn't actually mention MTU, but rather
allows you to get the maximum write size for Write Without Response,
which I think is the value most use cases need (it just happens to
be MTU - 3).
