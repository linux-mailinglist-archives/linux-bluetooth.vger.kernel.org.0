arket and I doubt I could get them to update the firmware as a random third=
 party. It works on Windows, so clearly Windows doesn't have a problem with=
 its noncompliance. So this raises the question, how should Linux handle no=
n-compliant hardware, especially when it could easily be made to work just =
by bending the rules in this one instance? I can absolutely change the comm=
it message since it's erroneous, but the question then comes down to how sh=
ould it be handled at all.

and break non-compliant hardware" or "figure out a way to bend the rules". =
Given that BlueZ, upon expanding the maximum size, does successfully read t=
he overly-long report map (it does use the read blob with offset message to=
 get the last several bytes), it does work as intended if we ignore that sp=
ecific rule. Though obviously that's up to the bluetooth maintainers to sol=
ve, so at this point I'm just tossing my two cents at it.

I went ahead and sent a patch myself, could you please verify it does
work the your device:
