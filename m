you would have to show the btmon trace for this. The extra connection is not needed for cross-transport pairing and seems to be iOS specific to check that the connection actually works.

From our side it is by design that if both transports use the same identity address, that both sides are being paired. So this is pretty much intentional. If you disable BR/EDR, then of course pairing will stick to just pair LE only.
