HID will not be auto-reconnected because the peripheral is responsible
for reconnecting. Most HID devices do not page scan unless they are
pairing (or at least that's what I've found in practice).

It looks like bluez5.55 was released on Sep 06
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tag/?h=3D5.55) and
my change was merged Sep 14
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/commit/?id=3D6611b72600=
c370ec31795ab48a222594c4afb7ee).

Depending on the profile implemented, not all peer devices will page
scan once disconnected. HID devices at least will not page scan and
are expected to initiate the reconnect themselves (i.e. suspend,
resume and then click your mouse; the mouse will reconnect).

If reconnecting to arbitrary profiles is desirable, you can merge this
patch (https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/bluetooth/patch/20201207154903.=
bluez.1.I3e043a481273442748bcff0728b2f0e208017cd2@changeid/).
