There are not so many people dedicated to upstream full time, besides
normally for big features like this we normally rely on companies
interested in the feature to support the work upstream.

Well you could consider asking the manufacturer, or google, to support
Linux in general, but I'm afraid they might push back saying they
support just the major OSes.
