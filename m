Sorry,  still don't understand.  After unload/blacklist the module, 
there will be no /sys/bus/usb/drivers/foo/new_id. Once we load the 
module, the on-board hci will be driven by the module immediately. Looks 
like setting new_id is only useful for USB dongles, for on-board usb 
devices,  I have no idea how to use the new_id.

Thanks,

Hui.
