Generally the device drivers detect whether it's in bootloader mode or
runtime firmware is uploaded. With the runtime firmware, it can also
query what version is running. However, there's currently no way to
read the version on disk because the firmware version isn't stored at
some known location in the firmware blob. That's the crux of the
problem here.

The nice thing about this solution is that it doesn't matter for
externally connected BT (since they will reset to bootloader mode
anyway).

Let's walk through an example: bus 1-6 for internal BT and bus 3-2 for
external BT

- System powers on with both connected. Bus 1-6 loads runtime firmware
and updates module FW table. Bus 3-2 loads runtime firmware and
updates module FW table.
- Unplug external BT. Power down USB to cause 1-6 to disconnect.
- Plug in external BT. External BT is in bootloader mode so it doesn't
check the module FW table. It loads runtime firmware and updates the
module FW table (adding 3-2).
- Power up USB to cause internal BT to connect. Internal BT is not in
bootloader mode (because only USB was powered down). It checks the
module FW table, sees that FW was loaded on the current module load
and doesn't attempt to upload it again.
- Unload module, reload module.
- Internal BT loads, finds that it is in runtime firmware, checks FW
module table, sees it hasn't loaded FW and so forces the BT to
bootloader mode to reload new FW
- External BT loads, finds that it is in runtime firmware (no unplug),
checks FW module table, sees it hasn't loaded FW and so forces the
external BT to bootloader mode to reload new FW

As long as the module is up, it will not reload the FW for BT if it
was originally loaded by the currently running module. Reloading the
module is equivalent to reloading the FW on the BT controllers.

I think this would be the desirable behavior in all cases
(development, reboot forcing new firmware to load, etc).
