It's detectable but the only device I tested it was Sony DualShock 4 which acts
as master that connects PC to itself which uses "sixaxis" hacks in bluez. And,
in the end, it was a failure: DS4 does not want to pass input data and then
promptly shuts itself off after "pairing". It does work under Windows® with
that dongle but on Linux I had to resort to old BT 2.1 one.

The more important thing is "fixup" parameter patches that allow to at select
hacks per device and at least figure out what it needs without recompiling and
rebooting kernel every time. But, apparently, BT maintainer is not interested
in BT stack being as robust and easy to test as USB either.

I'm pretty sure that the problem is not just that those CSR chips may require
hacks by themselves but that "manufacturers" have flashed them with
inappropriate/misconfigured firmwares without testing, other than trying
something on Windows®, and then flooded Ebay and Aliexpress with those
unlicensed fakes. It's pretty much all you can get in an adequate "simple
dongle" price range. But Windows® manages to avoid those issues somehow,
meaning that Linux's BT stack is too picky, pedantic and too hardcoded for
unnecessary things. And that is something maintainers should care about. We
shouldn't keep figuring out crutches for every model & revision for things that
are not even required for device's purpose.
