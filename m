I didn't tested Your patch but after looking at the code it seems that
just applying Your patch would solve my problem.
Regarding avrcp version, in android there is developer option to set
avrcp version. For example my Xiaomi redmi 8 (android 10) reports
version according to this setting, but samsung galaxy s7 (android 8)
always report version 1.4 regardless of this setting.

One thing is not clear for me, what is the purpose of the
supported_events ?  It is used in two places:
First is the avrcp_handle_register_notification function. If the
remote side want to register itself for specific event notification it
does not matter what version of avrcp that remote side supports. If it
ask for specific event it clearly support that event.
Second is in avrcp_handle_get_capabilities in CAP_EVENTS_SUPPORTED
case. Does it matter if local side reply with events that are not
supported in the version of avrcp supported by the remote side ?
