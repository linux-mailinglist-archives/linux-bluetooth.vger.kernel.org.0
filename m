the information are needed, but not that struct. It makes no sense to hand this problem of configuring the PCM data path correctly to the profile code. So I am not going to do that. The profile itself has no interest in how the platform is built. What you are going to do is configure possible PCM data path options and then the kernel will use that information for Enhanced Sync Setup. However the profile should only provide the over-the-air settings since that is what is going to be negotiated during the profile setup.

Marcel
