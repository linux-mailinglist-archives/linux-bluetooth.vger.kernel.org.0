Hi Bastien,

Thank you for the feedback. Please find my answers below.

For security, the API can be access-limited at D-Bus level using D-Bus
configuration files. For example, we can let only trusted UNIX users
as the callers for this API. This D-Bus config file would be
distribution-specific. In Chrome OS, for example, only the "audio" and
"power" users are allowed to call this API. This way we can make sure
that the callers do not abuse the API for denial-of-service kind of
attack.

Could you give an example of what potential problems of upower can be
caused by communicating with BlueZ through this API?
