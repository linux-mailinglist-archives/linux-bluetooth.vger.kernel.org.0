--- Comment #1 from The Linux kernel's regression tracker (Thorsten Leemhui=
s) (regressions@leemhuis.info) ---
[TLDR: I'm adding the regression report below to regzbot, the Linux
kernel regression tracking bot; all text you find below is compiled from
a few templates paragraphs you might have encountered already already
from similar mails.]

Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking.

CCing the regression mailing list, as it should be in the loop for all
regressions, as explained here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/reporting-issues.html

To be sure this issue doesn't fall through the cracks unnoticed, I'm
adding it to regzbot, my Linux kernel regression tracking bot:

#regzbot ^introduced b2af264ad3af437238c9500aa830ebcafb180e05
#regzbot title bluetooth: HSP/HFP mSBC profile broken with QCA6174
#regzbot ignore-activity
#regzbot link https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D215576

Reminder for developers: when fixing the issue, please add a 'Link:'
tags pointing to the report (the mail quoted above) using
lore.kernel.org/r/, as explained in
'Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst' and
'Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst'. This allows the bot to connect
the report with any patches posted or committed to fix the issue; this
again allows the bot to show the current status of regressions and
automatically resolve the issue when the fix hits the right tree.

I'm sending this to everyone that got the initial report, to make them
aware of the tracking. I also hope that messages like this motivate
people to directly get at least the regression mailing list and ideally
even regzbot involved when dealing with regressions, as messages like
this wouldn't be needed then.

Don't worry, I'll send further messages wrt to this regression just to
the lists (with a tag in the subject so people can filter them away), if
they are relevant just for regzbot. With a bit of luck no such messages
will be needed anyway.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
