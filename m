An optional property. That beeing said, dropping the *-gpios was the
solution for the Qualcomm DTS as well:

As I remember DT ABI must be backward compatible. I understand this as
followed: In our current use-case the dt-bindings don't describe any
required hw resource so we need to mark them as optional to be backward
compatible.

Regarding your above comment: "complete or not. Not half-done". Do you
see the current dt-bindings for this particular device as complete or
not? In other words can we mark the reset-gpios and vcc-supply
properties as required albeit this would break the DT ABI since all
current users don't specify it?

Okay so PMU is no option and we don't have to consider this idea any
longer. So reset-gpios and vcc-supply it is :) and I don't expect this
to change.
