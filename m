No, not at all, the bluetooth subsystem should move to actually use the
proper dynamic debug infrastructure and not have their own "special"
subsystem loging macros/functions.  What you are doing here is the
proper way forward, BUT you need to make everyone aware that it is going
to change how things work from what they do today.

In other words, it's not just a "trivial" change, you need to get
approval to change this type of functionality from the Bluetooth
developers/maintainers.
