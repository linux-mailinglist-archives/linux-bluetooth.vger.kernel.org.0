Cheap USB BT dongles that are bad clones of CSR  "ID 0a12:0001  
Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode)" have had  
historic problems, due to various bad behaviors.  See [Bug 60824]  
[PATCH][regression] Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle  
unusable (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi) for more details  
and background.  The patch in that bug was initially mainlined in 5.9,  
and underwent several revisions since then.  It has continued to work  
through all of the 5.19 series, but it does not work with any of the  
6.0 kernels.

I have made three unsuccessful attempts to git bisect using vanilla  
sources.  All settled on totally irrelevant commits.  These have all  
used v6.0-rc1 and v5.19 as the starting bad and good commits.

Having read all the pages on filing a [REGRESSION} bug, I'm a bit  
intimidated to file something without sufficient information to be  
taken seriously, but will do so using this information, if that seems  
the best course of action.

Thanks for any advice, including requests for additional information.

Below is the output from 'dmesg | egrep -iC2 "bt|blue" of a typical  
failed boot.  Note that unplugging and replugging the dongle (sometimes  
two or more times) will sometimes be successful in having it recognized  
and usable.
