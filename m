+=========================================
+Intro to GATT (Generic Attribute Profile)
+=========================================
+
+The Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) defines how two connected Bluetooth
+LE devices can share data using concepts called Services and Characteristics.
+Data is orgnaized into a hierarchical structure of profiles, services, and
+characteristics in the GATT database. The device containing the GATT database
+is known as the server device and the device accessing the GATT database is
+the client device. Only the database's services and characteristics are
+documented here.
+
+BlueZ provides D-Bus interfaces for accessing GATT services and profiles which
+are documented in the :doc:`D-Bus GATT APIs <dbus>` document.
+
+One-off usage and prototyping can also be done using the bluetoothctl
+command-line utility.
+
+UUIDs
+-----
+
+Services and characteristics are differentiated by Universally Unique
+Identifiers (UUIDs). For GATT there are several formats of UUIDs: 128-bit,
+32-bit, and 16-bit.
+
+128-bit UUIDs: Displayed in five groups of 32 hexadecimal digits separated
+by hyphens (e.g., 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000). 128-bit UUIDs allow
+for custom services and characteristics that do not conflict with those of
+other vendors or standard profiles defined by the Bluetooth SIG.
+
+32-bit UUIDs: A subset of the 128-bit UUID, where only 32 bits are used to
+represent the UUID. The UUID values fall within a certain range defined by
+the Bluetooth specification. The 32-bit value is inserted into a base UUID
+(UUUUUUUU-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB) to form a full 128-bit UUID. The
+UUUUUUUU in the base UUID is replaced by the 32-bit value. This format is
+used within the Bluetooth protocol for standardized services and profiles.
+
+16-bit UUIDs: Similar to the 32-bit UUID, but more common. This is also
+used for standardized services, characteristics, and descriptors defined by
+the Bluetooth SIG. The 16-bit value is inserted into a base UUID
+(0000UUUU-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB) to form a full 128-bit UUID.
+
+Services and Characteristics
+----------------------------
+
+Services: Collections of related data that together perform a specific
+function or feature of the device. Each service is identified by a
+UUID and contains Characteristics that define the actual data and behaviors
+of the service.
+
+Characteristics: Pieces of data under a service, representing a specific
+piece of information or a function of the device. Each characteristic can
+have its own unique value, associated properties and access permissions that
+define how it can be interacted with. These properties include read, write,
+notify, indicate, and more. A Characteristic may include one or more
+Descriptors that provide additional metadata or control specific aspects
+of the Characteristic's behavior.
+
+Properties
+----------
+
+Read Property: Allows a connected device to read the value of a characteristic.
+Information meant to be consumed but not altered by the client device, such
+as the device's battery level or sensor readings. Characteristics marked with
+the read property are essentially broadcasting their data to be accessed by
+other devices, ensuring that the information can be consumed without
+being modified.
+
+Write Property: Enables a connected device to change the value of a
+characteristic. An example of when a client device needs to alter data on the
+server device is a Bluetooth controlled light bulb, where the characteristic
+controlling the color or brightness of the light would have the write property,
+allowing external devices to modify these settings.
+
+Read/Write Property: Characteristics can also be configured to support both
+read and write properties simultaneously. This dual capability is useful for
+characteristics that hold information which not only needs to be displayed to
+external devices but also can be updated by them. For example, a Bluetooth
+thermostat may have a characteristic with read/write properties for the target
+temperature, enabling devices to both monitor the current setting and adjust
+it as needed.
+
+Notifications and Indications
+-----------------------------
+
+In addition to read and write properties,
+Bluetooth characteristics can also be configured to notify or indicate to
+connected devices when their value has changed. This is particularly useful
+for dynamic data that changes over time, such as sensor measurements or
+device status updates.
+
+Notifications: When a characteristic's notify property is enabled, it can
+send an update to connected devices whenever its value changes. This allows
+for real-time data streaming without the client having to continuously read
+the characteristic's value. Notifications are unacknowledged, meaning the
+sender does not receive confirmation that the message has been
+received successfully.
+
+Indications: Similar to notifications, indications inform connected devices
+about changes in a characteristic's value. The key difference is that
+indications are acknowledged; the receiver sends back a confirmation to the
+sender upon successfully receiving the update. This ensures reliable delivery
+of important data changes but at the cost of higher power consumption and
+potentially lower throughput due to the additional confirmation step.
+
+Organization of a GATT database The Bluetooth GATT database is a structured
+collection of values that are used to share information between two Bluetooth
+Low Energy (LE) devices. The GATT database is organized as a hierarchical
+structure composed of Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors. The two LE
+devices share the database information through read, writes, and subscription
+to notifications or indications of data values. The two LE devices perform
+this sharing by referencing 16-bit indexes known as "handles" which are
+numerical identifiers for each element in the GATT database. This avoids
+the need to use the UUIDs to reference the elements in the database.
+
+Service: A GATT database service is a collection of related functionalities
+that a device offers. It groups together one or more Characteristics that are
+logically related to perform a specific function or feature of the server
+device. Each service is identified by a UUID and contains Characteristics
+that define the actual data and behaviors of the service.
+
+Characteristic: Each characteristic can have its own unique value, associated
+properties, and access permissions that define how it can be interacted with.
+These properties include read, write, notify, indicate, and more. A
+Characteristic may include one or more Descriptors that provide additional
+metadata or control specific aspects of the Characteristic's behavior.
+
+Descriptors: A descriptor is an optional attribute that describes or controls
+certain aspects of a Characteristic's behavior. They provide additional context
+or metadata about a Characteristic. Some common types of Descriptors include the
+Characteristic User Description (provides human-readable description), the
+Characteristic Presentation Format (defines the format of the Characteristic
+value), and the Client Characteristic Configuration (used to enable or
+disable notifications or indications for a Characteristic).
+
+Handles: Every element in the GATT database (Service, Characteristic,
+Descriptor) is assigned a unique handle. Handles are 16-bit numerical
+identifiers that are used to reference these elements in GATT operations.
+The handles are used to avoid the need to use the UUIDs to reference the
+elements in the database.
