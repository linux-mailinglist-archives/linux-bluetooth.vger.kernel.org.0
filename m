Ok.

For the record - I understand the hesitation to "trust" the applications
to correctly handle security and I don't mean to dispute this. I
understand that once keys are exfiltrated from a network, all hell
might break loose.

Leaking meshd's tokens does not lead to that situation - at worst, one
could impersonate a single node.

I also agree that key export is sensitive and accesing these should
require some kind of authorization scheme.

This sounds complex.

Stefan raised a point about app and net keys being visible in plaintext
when application attempts to configure a node (both local and remote).

This might lead to adding encryption to mesh payloads exchanged between
the daemon and the application. Such a thing would IMO defeat the whole
idea of mesh stack implemented as a system service - it would be easier
to implement this behaviour as a library and do all the crypto on the
application side.

As far as I know, there are only a handful of D-Bus daemon
implementations out there, and I don't think that any of them is
inherently insecure. Sure, there might be bugs and vulnerabilities, but
I am not aware of any implementation that includes an "insecure link".

Please keep in mind that D-Bus is confined within a single machine -
yes, there is a TCP transport, but virtually all setups have this turned
off, and IIRC freedeskop.org explicitly states that this feature should
not be used in a production environment.
