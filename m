Ack, it was added by patman tool, I will remove it before sending.

This is the starting position of the given pattern. For instance, if
we'd like to look for the pattern within a Manufacturer Data field
with value {0x01, 0x02, 0x03} starting from index 2. Given the
Manufacturer Data field is {0x00, 0xFF, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04}, the
matching would start from octet 0x01, and the result would be a match.
Perhaps I should rename "Index" to "Start_Position" or rename
"Monitor_index" to "Monitor_handle" to avoid confusion.

"Monitor_Handle" sounds good to me. I will add some examples.

The intention of this command is indeed to handle the restart of
bluetoothd. It's a good point that we may want to remove all monitors
of an application. Let me try to combine remove and remove all
commands in my next patch.
