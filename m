Understood. For others to reproduce later on, I think, it’s always good 
to have some hints, on what to do. Especially with Bluetooth where two 
devices are involved. Maybe share as much information as you can. (But, 
it’s also my personal opinion. It’s not required.)

Ah, then I made the wrong assumptions from the address 
chromeos-bluetooth-upstreaming@chromium.org. Sorry about that, and thank 
you for clearing that up. I am going to remember that.


Kind regards,
