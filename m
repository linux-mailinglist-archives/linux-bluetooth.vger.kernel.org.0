Ouch, that is quite an old version, have you considered using something new=

anything back.  It regards a GATT device that connects and operates correct=
ly.  The issue is when we call the Adapter1.RemoveDevice method for this de=
vice.  Some times the device is removed completely, and everything works fi=
ne.  Some times it fails and bluetoothd becomes unusable.  Even when I shut=
down and restart bluetoothd it doesn't operate correctly when restarting.  =
The difference is that when it works, at the end of the removal process, it=
 reconnects the device, tries to recreate the device, then removes it.  All=
 internally.  When things fail, those steps don't happen.  I've posted befo=
re the salient part of the Bluetooth log.  The only thing that will make bl=
uetoothd function correctly is to shut it down, remove all of the similar G=
ATT devices, then restart bluetoothd.
