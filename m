Giving a device the option to wake us up that is not set up for incoming connections makes no sense. We can discuss if certain LE advertising packets should wake us up, but that is a total different API in my book.

this is something for Luiz or Johan to comment on. Maybe our code is not as good as I was thinking in this regard. Or maybe this is actually legacy code that I am trying to rid of by requiring a mgmt API revision that has Add Device support.

In general once we bonded with a device, we should be able to assign certain properties to it that are kept persistently.
