When the HOG-related GATT object is available on D-Bus, that means the
internal HOG profile is not enabled in the first place, so there is
nothing to sniff anyway. Furthermore, the higher layer operating
system is also responsible to prevent this if it chooses to disable
BlueZ's internal HOG profile handler. If an operating system thinks
that it is safer to always enable internal HOG they can do just that,
as I mentioned I'm willing to add an option to always enable all
internal profiles.

Right, I missed that GAP should be an exception that it cannot be
disabled, I should've added that exception in my code.

However, it seems that you still don't want a single switch to disable
all internal profiles (even with GAP exception). I'm willing to modify
this feature to be a blocklist of profiles per device (say
BlockedProfiles property on Device1 interface), and this feature can
be disabled altogether (all profiles always enabled) for operating
systems that do not want it.

That idea is also similar to your service_api branch, so I will also
try to port your service_api branch on the master branch. I will test
this and I am okay with using this if it serves our purposes.
I do have a question, though: With this API design, the service
objects are not exposed until a remote profile is detected, and
sometimes a profile is not detected until connection takes place (if
the profile UUID is not in the advertisement). So, how does the BlueZ
client block certain profiles/services before connection takes place?
We can't wait until connection takes place because we already know
that we don't want certain profiles, and if we block a profile after
connection takes place would that work properly? I guess we still need
a way to block certain profiles in the Device1 API, and the blocked
profiles also need to be stored in store_device_info.
