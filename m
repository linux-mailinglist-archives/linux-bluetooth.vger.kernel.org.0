+Add Extended Advertising Parameters Command
+===========================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x0054
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Instance (1 Octet)
+				Flags (4 Octets)
+				Params (2 Octets)
+				Duration (2 Octets)
+				Timeout (2 Octets)
+				MinInterval (4 Octets)
+				MaxInterval (4 Octets)
+				TxPower (1 Octet)
+	Return Parameters:	Instance (1 Octet)
+				TxPower (1 Octet)
+				MaxAdvDataLen (1 Octet)
+				MaxScanRspLen (1 Octet)
+
+	This command is used to configure the parameters for Bluetooth Low
+	Energy advertising instance. This command is expected to be followed
+	by an Add Extended Advertising Data command to complete and enable
+	the advertising instance.
+
+	Added advertising information with this command will not be visible
+	immediately if advertising is enabled via the Set Advertising
+	command. The usage of the Set Advertising command takes precedence
+	over this command. Instance information is stored and will be
+	advertised once advertising via Set Advertising has been disabled.
+
+	The Instance identifier is a value between 1 and the number of
+	supported instances. The value 0 is reserved.
+
+	With the Flags value the type of advertising is controlled and
+	the following flags are defined:
+
+		0	Switch into Connectable mode
+		1	Advertise as Discoverable
+		2	Advertise as Limited Discoverable
+		3	Add Flags field to Adv_Data
+		4	Add TX Power field to Adv_Data
+		5	Add Appearance field to Scan_Rsp
+		6	Add Local Name in Scan_Rsp
+		7	Secondary Channel with LE 1M
+		8	Secondary Channel with LE 2M
+		9	Secondary Channel with LE Coded
+		12	The Duration parameter should be used
+		13	The Timeout parameter should be used
+		14	The Interval parameters should be used
+		15	The Tx Power parameter should be used
+
+	When the connectable flag is set, then the controller will use
+	undirected connectable advertising. The value of the connectable
+	setting can be overwritten this way. This is useful to switch a
+	controller into connectable mode only for LE operation. This is
+	similar to the mode 0x02 from the Set Advertising command.
+
+	When the connectable flag is not set, then the controller will
+	use advertising based on the connectable setting. When using
+	non-connectable or scannable advertising, the controller will
+	be programmed with a non-resolvable random address. When the
+	system is connectable, then the identity address or resolvable
+	private address will be used.
+
+	Using the connectable flag is useful for peripheral mode support
+	where BR/EDR (and/or LE) is controlled by Add Device. This allows
+	making the peripheral connectable without having to interfere
+	with the global connectable setting.
+
+	Secondary channel flags can be used to advertise in secondary
+	channel with the corresponding PHYs. These flag bits are mutually
+	exclusive and setting multiple will result in Invalid Parameter
+	error. Choosing either LE 1M or LE 2M will result in using
+	extended advertising on the primary channel with LE 1M and the
+	respectively LE 1M or LE 2M on the secondary channel. Choosing
+	LE Coded will result in using extended advertising on the primary
+	and secondary channels with LE Coded. Choosing none of these flags
+	will result in legacy advertising.
+
+	To allow future parameters to be optionally extended in this structure,
+	the flags member has been used to specify which of the structure
+	fields were purposefully set by the caller. Unspecified parameters will
+	be given sensible defaults by the kernel before the advertisement is
+	registered.
+
+	The Duration parameter configures the length of an Instance. The
+	value is in seconds. The default is 2 seconds.
+
+	If only one advertising Instance has been added, then the Duration
+	value will be ignored. It only applies for the case where multiple
+	Instances are configured. In that case every Instance will be
+	available for the Duration time and after that it switches to
+	the next one. This is a simple round-robin based approach.
+
+	The Timeout parameter configures the life-time of an Instance. In
+	case the value 0 is used it indicates no expiration time. If a
+	timeout value is provided, then the advertising Instance will be
+	automatically removed when the timeout passes. The value for the
+	timeout is in seconds. Powering down a controller will invalidate
+	all advertising Instances and it is not possible to add a new
+	Instance with a timeout when the controller is powered down.
+
+	When a Timeout is provided, then the Duration subtracts from
+	the actual Timeout value of that Instance. For example an Instance
+	with Timeout of 5 and Duration of 2 will be scheduled exactly 3
+	times, twice with 2 seconds and once with one second. Other
+	Instances have no influence on the Timeout.
+
+	MinInterval and MaxInterval define the minimum and maximum advertising
+	intervals, with units as number of .625ms advertising slots. The Max
+	interval is expected to be greater than or equal to the Min interval,
+	and both must have values in the range [0x000020, 0xFFFFFF]. If either
+	condition is not met, the registration will fail.
+
+	The provided Tx Power parameter will only be used if the controller
+	supports it, which can be determined by the presence of the
+	CanSetTxPower member of the Read Advertising Features command.
+
+	The acceptable range for requested Tx Power is defined in the spec
+	(Version 5.2 | Vol 4, Part E, page 2585) to be [-127, +20] dBm, and the
+	controller will select a power value up to the requested one. The
+	transmission power selected by the controller is not guaranteed
+	to match the requested one, so the reply will contain the power
+	chosen by the controller. If the requested Tx Power is outside
+	the valid range, the registration will fail.
+
+	Re-adding an already existing instance (i.e. issuing the Add Extended
+	Advertising Parameters command with an Instance identifier of an
+	existing instance) will update that instance's configuration. In this
+	case where no new instance is added, no Advertising Added event will
+	be generated. However, if the update of the instance fails, the
+	instance will be removed, and an Advertising Removed event will be
+	generated.
+
+	An instance being added or changed while another instance is
+	being advertised will not be visible immediately but only when
+	the new/changed instance is being scheduled by the round robin
+	advertising algorithm.
+
+	Changes to an instance that is currently being advertised will
+	cancel that instance and switch to the next instance. The changes
+	will be visible the next time the instance is scheduled for
+	advertising. In case a single instance is active, this means
+	that changes will be visible right away.
+
+	The MaxAdvDataLen return parameter indicates how large the data
+	payload can be in the subsequent Add Extended Advertising Data
+	Command, as it accounts for the data required for the selected flags.
+	Similarly, the MaxScanRspLen return parameter indicates how large
+	the scan response can be.
+
+	LE must already be enabled, and the controller must be powered,
+	otherwise a "rejected" status will be returned.
+
+	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or a
+	Command Status event on failure.
+
+	Possible errors:	Failed
+				Rejected
+				Not Supported
+				Invalid Parameters
+				Busy
+
+
+Add Extended Advertising Data Command
+=====================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x0055
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Instance (1 Octet)
+				Advertising Data Length (1 Octet)
+				Scan Response Length (1 Octet)
+				Advertising Data (0-255 Octets)
+				Scan Response (0-255 Octets)
+	Return Parameters:	Instance (1 Octet)
+
+	The Add Extended Advertising Data command is used to update the
+	advertising data of an existing advertising instance known to the
+	kernel. It is expected to be called after an Add Extended Advertising
+	Parameters command, as part of the advertisement registration
+	process.
+
+	If extended advertising is available, this call will initiate HCI
+	commands to set the instance's advertising data, set scan response
+	data, and then enable the instance. If extended advertising is
+	unavailable, the advertising instance structure maintained in kernel
+	will have its advertising data and scan response updated, and the
+	instance will either be scheduled immediately or left in the queue
+	for later advertisement as part of round-robin advertisement rotation
+	in software.
+
+	If Scan_Rsp_Len is zero and the flags defined in Add Extended
+	Advertising Parameters command do not have connectable flag set and
+	the global connectable setting is off, then non-connectable
+	advertising is used. If Scan_Rsp_Len is larger than zero and
+	connectable flag is not set and the global advertising is off,
+	then scannable advertising is used. This small difference is
+	supported to provide less air traffic for devices implementing
+	broadcaster role.
+
+	If the Instance provided does not match a known instance, or if the
+	provided advertising data or scan response are in an unrecognized
+	format, an "Invalid Parameters" status will be returned.
+
+	If a "Set LE" or Advertising command is still in progress, a "Busy"
+	status will be returned.
+
+	If the controller is not powered, a "rejected" status will be returned.
+
+	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or a
+	Command Status event on failure.
+
+	Possible errors:	Failed
+				Rejected
+				Invalid Parameters
+				Busy
+
+
