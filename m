Hi Martin,

 the normal Connect API?

I guess the intention was to have the application use the intended API
for devices already present _before_ calling ConnectDevice, so before
entering the address manually the application would enumerate the
existing devices and figure out if that was already present.

> An alternative would be to accommodate this special case (not scanned bef=
ore) in the implementation of the standard device Connect(bdaddr) function =
or if that makes no sense because Device objects must correspond to previou=
sly discovered, physical devices, then at least the adapter ConnectDevice f=
unction could take care of the two possible paths and simplify matters for =
the application developer.

I guess you probably know this but just in case someone look at the
archives it is better that we make some things clearer, while the core
spec allows connecting without scanning D-Bus are intend to be a
higher level API thus why ConnectDevice was not really necessary for a
long time and we just introduced it for qualification purpose or when
there are multiple adapter where one acts as scanner. Also ever since
the introduction of privacy (random addresses) APIs that takes
addresses becomes rather complicated to be used directly, and there
exists ways to scan for a specific address with pattern filtering:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc/adapter-api.txt=
#n122

That said I don't oppose to remove Already Exists error, but we should
be very clear that the use of such API should only be recommended with
users input and does not substitute the likes of Device.Connect.
