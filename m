The === should be length of the command name. Lets be consistent.

We do Num_AD_Types followed by the variable data length.

Status is not needed. We always have a a status. It we are consistent with some of the other commands we return Current_Settings and with thus indicate that Mesh Mode is active. We can discuss this a bit since we might not want to actually use Mesh Mode in Controller Information.

You need to be a bit more detailed and describes the Enable types and ranged for Window and Period etc.

I think this better done this way:

	Max_Handles
	Num_Handles
	Handles[i]

The Status here is pointless since we have that anyway. However we might need to indicate support for advertising extension and other bearer. So we need to make the future proof.

Status is not required.

Same here. And I think Handle should be just 1 Octet.

Didn’t you want to make the Instant 64-bit?
