Hi Marcel,

Indeed, we do have the packet_msg patch to carry the erroneous data
flag.  We will send results once validated.

However, the profile implementation will still need to know if
erroneous data reporting is enabled/supported and that the USB driver
is correctly using the alt setting on the USB isoch endpoint. As a
result, we still need to carry some form of notification that all of
these things are supported from kernel below.  Again, this is a
controller attribute, not a connection attribute so it may best be
served outside of the sco socket.

Thanks,
Alain
