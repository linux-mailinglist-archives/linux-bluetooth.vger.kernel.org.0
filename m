So I am no Bluetooth expert (not at this level). I was helping a 
colleague running

some Bluetooth applications on an embedded chip using Python and 
basically all of these

scripts were broken because of missing HAVE_BLUETOOTH_BLUETOOTH_H symbol 
(would be defined

with libbluetooth in place). Some time has passed to if details are 
required it may take some time from

me to recover them, but i can do. I clearly recall we were using 
bluetoothd in tandem with this python package

(which allegedly, required built-in bluetooth support to be enabled).

For reference:

https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Modules/socketmodule.h#L116
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Modules/socketmodule.h#L282

And perhaps more interestingly:
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Modules/socketmodule.c

Got it, let's go with the upstream approach then. I do not see any 
blocker besides kernel

discussions here. I am fine deprecating altogether the libbluetooth 
intermediate effort.

On the other side, since you mentioned, I can check which specific 
python libraries were using

libbluetooth and the above code path, to see if they were using already 
the legacy approach or

if it is however something that must be supported in Python.

Thanks!
