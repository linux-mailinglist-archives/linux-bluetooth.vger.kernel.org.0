There is indeed a database with traits based on mac-addresses [1].

You confirmed earlier that besides this versioning issue there's also
an initialization issue with supported_events. I assume this test was
without flipping the _init calls around?

That's not really surprising to me, in fact it is slightly weird that
other phones report the A/V_RemoteControl profile. A phone will always
be the audio source (thus the RemoteControlTarget), never the sink.

(Unless applying some hacks to libfluoride: it is possible to use an
older phone as A2DP sink - for example to connect to a receiver at the
other side of the room. I would have enabled it on all my phones if it
didn't break A2DP source capabilities at the same time... Maybe
Gabeldorsche addresses that)

I will send a _preliminary_ patch to this thread that should resolve
both the versioning and ordering issue as I've finally figured a way
to check whether the session associated with an AVRCP command is
running as source or sink. It is not finalized yet so please don't be
too hard on it :)
