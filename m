and it should still be for telephony functionality.

Have you looked at my proposed API and design document? If not, please
really look at it... I already sent links in first email, but here are:

https://github.com/pali/hsphfpd-prototype/raw/prototype/README
https://github.com/pali/hsphfpd-prototype/raw/prototype/hsphfpd.txt

And if it is not clean how API works or how Agent should behave or how
whole ecosystem should work, please let me know which parts are not
clean so I can update it or explain even more.

All telephony AT commands (more specially, those which are not HFP
specific or which should not be handled by hsphfpd itself) are forwarded
to Telephony Agent. Ofono should be that Telephony Agent for hsphfpd for
handling all telephony stuff.

My hsphfpd daemon does not handle telephony functionality (except just
few commands which are required for HFP to work, but hsphfpd handles it
only when Telephony Agent is not connected).

Intension of hsphfpd is to dead with all these problems. For all new
functionality which would be introduced in future by vendors, hsphfpd
should be easily extended to either directly support this functionality
or to expose DBus API (or DBus file descriptor with AT socket) for
external application which would handle it.

Yes, some AT parser would be still needed...

I'm not sure if I understand it correctly, but does it mean to include
whole hsphfpd functionality into "bluez plugin" and bluetooth daemon
would then run this plugin, instead having hsphfpd in separate process?
