scrap this one. It is too noisy.

Remove BlueCore and BlueSoleil from here. All CSR chips are BlueCore chips. The BlueSoleil was a host stack as far as I remember.

Scrap the bt_dev_info here.

So you are saying the new ones can’t do LE scan and BR/EDR inquiry? That makes no sense since the “old" CSR chips are all BR/EDR only.

Also no need for the bt_dev_info here.

Use bt_dev_warn here, but scrap the workaround mention since we don’t add one.

If you do this, then please introduce BTUSB_INTEL_CSR and assign it to the one Intel controller that was using a CSR chip instead of its own silicon.
