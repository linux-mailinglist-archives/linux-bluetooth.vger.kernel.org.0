Hi Ismael,

> For some reason they tend to squat on the very first CSR/

> 
> Linux is the only place where they don't work due to spotty checks

> Changes in v4:
> * Chain the is_fake conditions with else ifs.
> * Properly use le16_to_cpu() when needed.
> 
> Changes in v3:
> * Find an even better-er way of detecting which type is which; use the
>  best parts of v1 and v2 and combine them with previous feedback.
> * Additionally, detect fakes by comparing against real BlueCore
>  firmware numbers and their supported protocol versions.
> * Introduce HCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_ERR_DATA_REPORTING and use it on all
>  fake chips. It doesn't seem to cause any drawback, and if we
>  make it too specific a lot of these chips won't work at all,

>  with this fix.
> * Limit the use of btusb_setup_csr() only to cover 0A12:0001.
> * Use bt_dev_warn for the fake detection notice.
> * Remove all other noisy bt_dev_info() calls.
> 
> Changes in v2:
> * Find a better way of detecting which type is which; scrap the wonky
>> =Bluetooth 1.2 protocol check and instead do what's described above.
> * Move all the quirk logic to btusb_setup_csr(), simplify it a bit.
> * Use a switch statement and list all the known broken bcdDevice
>  instead of trying to penalize the real CSR devices.
> * Add two bt_dev_info() prints because this may be important in the
>  future, given the amount of variables we are playing with here.
> * Try to keep my comments within a 80-column limit.

> This patch probably uncovers other quirks in some of these
