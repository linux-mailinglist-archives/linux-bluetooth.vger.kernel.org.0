We should probably create a test in l2cap-tester using SO_SNDTIMEO
first, so we can make sure CI test such case and we are able to detect
if the problem is reintroduced later:

This above should probably be sent separately.

I'm fine with this change, but we better use the likes of bt_dev_dbg
instead of BT_DBG.

These I'm not very comfortable applying as they are, I'm afraid there
could be regressions if they are not accompanied with proper tests,
besides I think there are less intrusive ways to cleanup l2cap_conn,
see below.

I think the problem is that the lifetime of l2cap_conn shall be hooked
with hci_chan, but the likes of hci_chan_list_flush -> hci_chan_del
don't actually trigger l2cap_conn_del, which imo is the culprit here,
because connect_cfm/disconnect_cfm is not called when the connection
procedure has been aborted prematurely, so perhaps we shall get rid of
the likes of l2cap_connect_cfm/l2cap_disconn_cfm and instead do the
cleanup with in the following order:
hci_conn_cleanup->hci_chan_list_flush->hci_chan_del->l2cap_conn_del,
that way we avoid having multiple code paths attempting to cleanup
objects associated with hci_conn/hci_chan.

I'd change hci_chan_create to take a del callback to avoid having
circular dependencies on one another though.
