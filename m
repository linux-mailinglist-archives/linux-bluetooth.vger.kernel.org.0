  shared/bap: Fix not detaching streams when PAC is removed

When local PAC is removed we attempt to release the streams but we left
it still attached to the endpoint, so this makes sure the stream is
properly detached by setting its state to idle.

  tools/mesh: Optimize for multiple RPR servers and NPPI

These changes allow the mesh-cfgclient tool to request remote node
compositions from page 128. Depending on the differences between
there and what is stored in the local configuration database, it may
recomend reprovisioning with NPPI-1 (Address Refresh) or NPPI-2
(Composition Refresh).

Additionally, NPPI-0 may be performed to refresh the Device Key only.

new fundamental models supported by bluetooth-meshd daemon.
Also, update to include explicit element locations and handle
different ordering of model IDs in the composition data.

  shared: define MAX_INPUT for musl

musl systems don't have MAX_INPUT. Just define it to _POSIX_MAX_INPUT
which musl does have if it's not already defined.

Note that on glibc, the values match anyway (as of glibc-2.36), and
indeed POSIX_MAX_INPUT has the same value on musl too.

  shared/bap: fix local endpoint state to be per-client

ASCS v1.0 Sec. 4.1: "For each ASE characteristic (distinguished by their
attribute handles), the server shall expose separate ASE characteristic
values for each client."  In shared/bap.c, the ASE chrc value is
contained in bt_bap_endpoint struct.

As implemented currently, the same local ASE chrc value is shared
between all clients, in contradiction with the above.  Namely, the
bt_bap_endpoint is looked up based on the gatt_db_attribute handles, in
bap_get_endpoint and bap_get_endpoint_id, but the handles correspond to
the ASCS registrations, and do not depend on which client is in
question.

Fix this by moving the endpoint states to the bt_bap BAP session struct,
so that the ASE state is associated with the sessions, and each session
has separate state.

  media: clear the right transport when clearing BAP endpoint

Each configured BAP stream is associated with a transport, and only that
transport should be cleared when the stream's configuration is cleared.

This is required for multiple BAP clients to use the same Media1
endpoint, which is what we should aim for to follow the spirit in which
the endpoints work in ASCS.  Sound servers generally can handle this,
since the *Configuration calls provide the transport paths, and for
different clients they are associated with different devices.

  media: look up BAP transports by their associated stream

To look up transports, use BAP stream pointers associated with them, not
the path strings stored in the stream user data. This makes it clearer
that transports presented to the sound server correspond to the actual
streams.  The Acquire/etc. of BAP transports are already tied to the
associated stream.

This fixes use-after-free crashes in pac_clear.  They occur because the
lifetime of the path string was either that of media transport or media
endpoint, which may be shorter than that of the BAP stream.  In such
case, pac_clear is entered with invalid pointer in stream user data,
leading to crash.  There are a few code paths for this, e.g. making
sound server delay its SetConfiguration response (e.g. gdb breakpoint)
to get dbus timeout, then disconnecting:

  audio/transport: update BAP transport QOS values when changed

Currently, BAP transport publishes on DBus QOS values obtained at
transport creation time. For BAP server the transport creation usually
occurs before stream QOS is configured, and these values are then all
zero. bap->sdu is also never set.

Update transport QOS values in DBus when stream state changes.  Since
nearly all QOS values are exposed in the transport, use bt_bap_qos to
store them there for simplicity.

  configure: Check ell path

If the 'enable-external-ell' is not specified in the configure parameter,
the build system assumes that the ELL source is located same level where
the bluez source is cloned. But the configure doens't check the folder
and user will get the build error while building the source.

This patch checks if the ELL source path if the 'enable-external-ell'
flag is not set and throws an error if the ELL doesn't exist.

  device: wait GATT client ready before service accept() if no cache

On device ATT attach, do not immediately call accept() for profiles, if
there is no cached data in GATT database. Instead, wait for service
resolution to complete, as likely accept() cannot succeed before that.

Several profiles (bap, vcp, midi, deviceinfo) assume that GATT
attributes are available when their accept() is called, returning
success even if not.  In this case, the services never find the remote
attributes and are not operable.  Other profiles (hog, batt, ...) fail
their accept which prompts core to retry after discovery, and work
correctly also in this case.

Fix the failing services by waiting for service resolution as necessary,
so profiles can assume the GATT DB has some content.

The patch helps to generate Resolvable set identifier adv data.
which can be used as ADV data during advertisement.
It will be used to identify the device as part of setmember for
Coordinated set identification profile.
Example:
$<path to advtest/>advtest -i "761FAE703ED681F0C50B34155B6434FB"
SIRK: 761FAE703ED681F0C50B34155B6434FB

  mesh: Fix node when loading from storage

This fixes adding mandatory models (config server, remote provisioner)
to a node whose configuration is being loaded from storage:
mesh_model_add() was called with a wrong argument.

Was:     mesh_model_add(..., PRIMARY_ELE_IDX, ...);
Correct: mesh_model_add(..., ele->models, ...);
