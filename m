and what about Bluetooth 4.2 spec. devices? Not all earlier specs have both features.

I prefer Set Device Flags since with Get Device Flags you can indicate if this is supported or not.

Then we can do that and use Limited Privacy mode for exactly that. However in addition I would use the Set Device Flags to allow punching holes for specific devices.
