I looked into the same issue earlier this year, see
20200118194841.439036-1-marijns95@gmail.com [1].  The gist of it is that BlueZ
bases supported_events solely on the remote AVRCP controller version, which
Android sets to 1.3 when it is a media source [2].  This version is not
relevant in your use-case because the Android phone is the AVRCP target while
blueZ is the controller.

It was decided in that mail thread to split supported_events in two; one based
on the external controller version (when BlueZ operates as target it'll
validate incoming notification registrations) and the other based on what BlueZ
currently supports as controller.

The second check might not be all too relevant and is already covered by the
switch-case; perhaps it makes more sense to base this check on the external
target version, and again validate whether we expect to receive that particular
notification registration?

Both checks together implicitly validate what BlueZ supports locally in its
role of controller or target, as remote_{target,controller}_supported_events
(anticipated names of the new members replacing supported_events) will only be
set to events that BlueZ is able to emit.

Unfortunately my ramblings in that mail shadowed an important question: how to
determine in avrcp_handle_register_notification whether BlueZ is running as
controller or target?  set_volume in transport.c derives this from
transport->source_watch but there seems to be no easy access to the
accompanying transport in avrcp_handle_register_notification.  With this
question answered I'll be able to update and resubmit the original patch.
