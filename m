When I tried to connect a bluetooth gamepad 8718,
I was experiencing a crash which can be reproduced
always.

After investigation, it appears that instance was not reffed initially
when added to the slist and double free was requested on this hog during
the free of the slist (unref during a destroy_gatt_req).
