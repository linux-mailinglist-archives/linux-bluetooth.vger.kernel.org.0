I don't think so.... If a token is leaked, and we offer *any* kind of mechanism to export keys, then any permissions that the App with legitimate access to the token has, is then conferred on *any* entity that obtains access to the token.  

The only way around this is to not allow any access, by any apps, to any exportable keys....   or to secure access to the token.
