I suspect the following change shall make it behave as before, the use
of hci_cmd_sync_queue is not equivalent to hci_req_sync:

https://gist.github.com/Vudentz/b78f34e3775c8cd2db55b868e5c8ef42

That said, I'm considering removing the whole custom handling for
HCI_QUIRK_STRICT_DUPLICATE_FILTER and just disable duplicate filtering
when this flag is set.
