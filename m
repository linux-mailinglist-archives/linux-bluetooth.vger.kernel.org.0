> This was added to give applications more visibility into why a monitor wa=
s not accepted. I agree that once the code is stable, most of the release r=
easons may become useless. However, the reason code "4 - Monitor already ex=
ists" may still happen. If more than one application creates monitors for t=
he same pattern but with different RSSI parameters, BlueZ merges those moni=
tors and sends it to the kernel as controllers do not accept monitors with =
the duplicate patterns. So, if RSSI parameters do not overlap with the exis=
ting monitors, BlueZ cannot merge such monitors and hence needs to release =
it. This error code will help applications to capture such scenarios and up=
date the RSSI parameters accordingly on the fly.

Not sure how the application will be able to correct the RSSI to fit
if it doesn't have access to all other monitors active in the system,
and even in case you have access to other monitors then you could
check this beforehand. I'm afraid we will need to find a way to make
this work transparently, perhaps have the RSSI updated either on the
application (strict) or in controller (relax).

> For the reason code "8 - App unregistered/destroyed", Release may not get=
 delivered if the app is already destroyed. But applications can unregister=
 Advertisement Monitor interface with BlueZ even if they are not exiting. I=
n such a case, Release will be delivered for all previously active monitors=
 of that application. This may help to notify applications to remove the mo=
nitor D-Bus objects if they want.

Well that removes the App destroyed then, also in case of Unregister
we normally don't attempt to reach out the object if it has been
unregistered since it is the application that is initiating the action
it should be aware that it has to release these objects so we avoid
extra traffic on D-Bus, specially in case the application is being
terminated and decide to call Unregister in the process, which it
probably shouldn't since we would cleanup anyway when it disconnects
from D-Bus, in fact I consider Unregister as a group Release and if
the application wants to register one by one then it should use
ObjectManager.InterfacesRemoves so its proxies are individually
removed.

Release is only really useful when initiated by the daemon itself,
like the adapter being unregistered, etc.
