This is something which needs to be tested. And without full
implementation (with control of all parameters) we cannot say YES or NO.

And if you are aware of bandwidth, Enhanced Setup Synchronous Connection
HCI command allows you to use also software based CVSD codec. Meaning
that CVSD encoding/decoding can be done by application and therefore
decreasing amount of data to transfer to bluetooth adapter.

As I said this command is needed also if you want to use mSBC hw encoder
over PCM, so I think usage of Enhanced Setup Synchronous Connection HCI
command always have benefits to implement it (I have unfinished and
untested implementation).

That is a good question if power consumption would be increased or
decreased. Anyway, hw encoding may be able to achieve lower latency. So
I rather do not drop it prematurely without any tests.

And another important thing, not all bluetooth adapters are USB based,
there are adapters connected over UART and SDIO. And every bus can
behave differently. USB is domain of laptops, UART can be found on
raspberry pi which is also heavily used. SDIO bluetooth is less used but
I have there at least device on which is running mainline kernel (5.10)
and has SDIO bluetooth.
