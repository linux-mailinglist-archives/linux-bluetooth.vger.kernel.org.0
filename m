Hello all,

I'm currently (once again) trying to get different BT headsets working
on Linux, with good audio quality also for telephony. It's
unfortunately still the same issue: I can get good quality for playback
only, but as soon as I start using HSP or HFP profiles to enable and
use the headset's microphone, I will have poor audio quality only.
Unfortunately this stops me (and I guess many other users) from being
able to use any wireless headset on Linux desktop.

On an Android phone the same headsets are working fine, also with the
microphone enabled, with good audio quality.

What can be done to finally make this work on Linux desktop?
As far as I understand HFP profile with a supported codec has to be
used, to get telephony with better quality.
All the hard work Pali did for this seems to be the most promising
solution for this right now, as far as I can tell.

What can be done to get his patch merged?
What is currently blocking this or what are the reasons / open issues
why it can't be merged?

I'm willing to support if I can! At least  I can offer some of my time
for manually installing and testing this, if it helps.
I've also updated the patch already to let it compile successfully with
newer kernel version (tried with linux58) and I can provide this
updated version if it helps. (but I am not sure if everything works as
it should)

I hope this can be pushed forward. Would make me (and many other) users
so happy to finally get wireless headphones working better!

Thanks to all of you for your hard work!! (and I know, very often in
your free time!)

Best,

Joschi
