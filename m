Well I guess you are forgetting that other users of the GATT may
interfere with plugin which is why we do the claim APIs in the first
place.

Reading is done automatically if the plugin is enabled, you can
disable the plugin if you don want it to be automatically read, having
both will not gonna happen since it will incur in more traffic in this
case and may have security implication in services such as HoG.

Not if the service has security implication, for instance we don't
want application to be able to access the keys presses coming from a
HoG device, or other things like changing the settings bluetoothd has
configured.

But there is even a stronger argument if something breaks because the
app access something it shouldn't, even if there are no conflicts
between the plugin the very least it would cause is duplicating the
traffic.
