That will likely require a lot of work to get working since we would
endup with the same device object, if this really exists in real life
Im afraid it breaks a lot of things in the process and it will never
be backwards compatible, so I'm really not convinced this is the right
thing to do, in fact Id claim that if a device wants to have separate
pairing/bonding procedures then it must use different addresses which
means the LE bearer shall probably use a random static address rather
than attempt to reuse the same identity address of BR/EDR, afterall it
want to have distinct devices so it really makes no sense to keep
using the same address.
