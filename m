So is it possible for me to set the above values I require in main.conf?

There's no documentation showing that it's possible to set the values
in main.conf.

If not then I think that surely the override to disable the service
being provided by BlueZ needs to be added?

At the time the code was added it was even picked up that it would
break operationality and suggested a kill switch to be added,  but now
I'm reporting it as a bug it's not going to be added?
