I think it should be user configurable and I'm not sure what defaults
make sense for general Linux distributions. For ChromeOS, we only want
a2dp-sink.

I've linked the patch series making it more configurable in previous
emails (https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/bluetooth/patch/20201207154903=
.bluez.1.I3e043a481273442748bcff0728b2f0e208017cd2@changeid/).
If you agree that behavior is necessary, please make your case to the
bluez maintainer (Luiz).

From what you've described, that seems to be the case. I would expect
wakelocks to prevent suspend notifiers as well so this seems like a
bug in the suspend code. You should submit a patch to check that there
isn't a pending wakeup in enter_state since that's the case:
