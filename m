The main use-case is software volume compensation for devices with 
limited granularity, for which we need to know exactly what is replied 
to AVRCP's SetAbsoluteVolume call.  Delaying 
g_dbus_pending_property_success will only block the call longer but 
won't exactly let us know the resulting value.  We can immediately Get 
the new property after (or try and relate the change notification to 
it), but there's nothing preventing a change on the device intervening. 
  In that case we should discard requested volume (on the host) and 
software compensation, and take/display device volume as-is.
This seems unfortunate as the AVRCP spec provides exactly the 
consistency we're looking for here.

As for user experience it seems acceptable to make such a call block 
until the peer replies, if only for a much more predictable API.  It is 
then up to the caller (ie. PulseAudio) to deal with that by 
disabling/blocking the slider, or scheduling the most recent volume 
update to be sent as soon as a reply is received (the DBus call returns).
