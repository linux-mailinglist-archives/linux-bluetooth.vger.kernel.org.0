Giving a device the option to wake us up that is not set up for incoming connections makes no sense. We can discuss if certain LE advertising packets should wake us up, but that is a total different API in my book.

I like to give Johan and Luiz some time to look at userspace code and see where this fits best.

My proposal would be to ignore the API question for a bit. Keep the mgmt command you have for testing for now. Switching over to a different command is done within an hour once we have the internals solid.

As I commented in my review, I would store the BR/EDR ones in the wakeable list and the LE ones as a flag or parameter in the conn params list. My real concern is the complexity your patch set adds. We really need to streamline this and make things simpler. The whitelist update worries me a lot. That code path is already rather complicated and we should not add to it.

For me it looks like you designed this based on the API that mgmt exposes (aka your first patch in the patch set). That leads you on a path that I feel is too complicated. So I would do this complete opposite and figure out the tasks and what information of wakeable or not you need at what point and where are they best places for BR/EDR and LE in hci_dev.

As an example, the whole complexity of disconnecting all devices and disabling page scan and scanning etc. is something that we can get merged quickly. If I assume an empty list of wakeable devices, then I would still disconnect all devices, disable page scan and scanning and also suspend all advertising and discovery.

I fully realize that this is a lot of work, but we need to get this support done right. I already foresee that you might want to have a keep advertising while suspend flag to advertise some sort of non-connectable beacon (like a find me hint). And at that point I don’t want to have to rethink the whole code path again.

Also please don’t be shy and tell if we did things totally stupid. We can change existing code as long as mgmt API stays backwards compatible. I am a big fan of fixing things to make code simpler and make maintenance easier.

Regards

Marcel
