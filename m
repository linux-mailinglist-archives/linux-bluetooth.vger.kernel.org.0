Hi Barry,

Perhaps of relevance: Sanchayan (cc'd) imporved some scripts for Python
3 compatibility (Python 2 is already deprecated for the better part of
1.5 years) and proper formatting [1] while working on BT LDAC [2], some
patches made it to the list [3] but were ultimately never merged.
Sanchayan, would you be willing to resubmit these?  Alternatively Barry
can pick them up as part of their quest to improve the scripts for
longevity?

Disclaimer: I'm not a maintainer, merely a passer-by so don't take my
comment as an acknowledgement to go ahead with the changes.  But if you
do I think everyone appreciates improved shebangs and PEP8 style
formatting (I find `black` to perform formatting nicely) along the way
just like Sanchayan's patches.
