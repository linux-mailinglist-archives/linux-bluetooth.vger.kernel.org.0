I have indeed missed this distinction entirely. Looking at the AVRCP
spec (1.6) section 2.2.1 "Roles" the CT/TG naming indeed denotes
initiator and receiver, respectively. I blindly assumed these matched
the roles of "target" and "remote"/"controller" following the naming
of the profiles. Knowing this makes reading section 6.18 much more
clear; the sink is assumed to be the TG only in the specific case of
the SetAbsoluteVolume call, for example. I will update the commit to
mention "target" and "controller" instead (like the rest of the code),
hopefully finding and clearing up the typo that way.

If there is any code it must be very minor, as I have based the
sink/CT, source/TG association solely on the AVRCP documentation. I do
see it in the creation of of sdp records though, is that what you're
hinting at?
According to the documentation it is likely the CT requests a
notification, and the TG completes it in due time. But because both
the controller and the target can fulfill the CT and TG role (keeping
in mind predefined directionality in for example SetAbsoluteVolume), I
don't think that distinction should make it into my patch. Instead,
the separation will be solely based on what the local/peer controller
and target support. The issue still holds that BlueZ in controller
role incorrectly rejects notification registrations, because
supported_events is merely based on the peer controller version.
Splitting supported events seems the way forward: I'll improve the
patch and resubmit it, then we can decide. Likewise, should
registered_events be separated across the target and controller role
too? Or is it unexpected to have a target _and_ controller running on
both devices, simultaneously (this would imply two transports, in both
directions, playing back media)?

Locally supported events seem hard to quantify as BlueZ can send out
events for anything that's physically in the code at any point
(supposedly anything available according to AVRCP_{CT,TG}_VERSION),
unless we want to prevent the CT from requesting notifications it
couldn't realistically support given its profile version.

I will update this to take into account the target/controller role at
the time the call is made. Is there any way to figure out what role
the TG is fulfilling? set_volume in transport.c for example bases that
on whether the transport has source_watch set, meaning the device is
the sink playing back audio from a peer device which is the source.
