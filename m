Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker. Top-posting
for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

@Luiz Augusto von Dentz: did you make any progress to get this into net
to make sure this rather sooner then later heads to mainline? Doesn't
looks like it from here, but maybe I'm missing something.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
