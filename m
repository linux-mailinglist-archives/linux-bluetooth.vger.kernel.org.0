So if I understand you correctly the problem is that Status does
transit directly to complete and end up swallowing the active state?
That is not necessarily a bug since the file would still be saved.

This doesn't sound right, we have chk_put callback that calls into
manager_request_authorization and that blocks untils the
agent->auth_pending responds, so it sounds like the agent is not
responding in time or windows is using ftp instead of opp? Well ftp
doesn't even use AuthorizePush, I'm also confused about the mention of
a cache directory and user specified directory, there are no such
things there only the root directory option which is used as default
location and AuthorizePush can opt to store in a different location if
necessary, but the transfer doesn't start until the agent reply
AuthorizePush or at least that what the code assumes with:

/* Workaround: process events while agent doesn't reply */
while (agent && agent->auth_pending)
g_main_context_iteration(NULL, TRUE);

Is ~/.cache/obexd its passed as -r/--root to obexd? Could it be that
the agent doesn't respond for some reason? e.g. the transfer status is
not active?

The method is used to accept the request, so something else is broken
if the file ends up being accepted before the user is able to accept
it, also it is probably a security breach if small files can bypass
the user authorization.
