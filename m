Andreas,

Considering that this patch has already made it's way into stable trees, 
and the only options are to back it out or to patch it again, I would 
obviously prefer to keep it in and patch it again.  I think that it 
would be fairly quick and painless to just set the default min/max to 
6/3200, or add an additional flag as you suggested, which should resolve 
any problems in the near term.

Longer term, I think that there are several ways to allow the system 
admin to configure the allowable min/max, but it only matters if the 
system will check requests against the configured min/max and respond 
appropriately, which is what the patch in question does.  The best 
current way that I'm aware of to control the system-wide connection 
interval is through the existing debugfs mechanism, and in my opinion it 
didn't work correctly without this patch.

Regarding power consumption, I have not done any power measurement 
testing to determine the effect of connection interval on power 
consumption, so perhaps that was not the best use case.  Here is the 
exact real world use case that caused me to write the patch in the first 
place:

I was writing a Linux-based test system for an embedded 
BLE-communication based product.  The product embedded code was written 
to attempt to renegotiate the connection interval to a fairly low number 
after the initial connection was established. My test system had a 
requirement to be able to perform the tests using various pre-defined 
connection intervals so that I could gather data throughput and product 
performance metrics.  Every time my test system attempted to perform a 
test a the desired connection interval, the device would immediately 
request to renegiate to a lower value.  Linux would accept that request 
and return a successful response, and I had no way to stop it.  Let's 
not go down the "Why didn't you just change the embedded code?" / "Why 
doesn't Linux reject values outside of the configured bounds?" rabbit 
hole...  :)
