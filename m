This event is reported only twice per bt-device (at start and at end of the monitoring); and it includes only the device addr and addr type [1]. To include other fields from the Device Found event, we need to buffer MSFT_Monitor_Device in the kernel and wait for the subsequent advertising report before we can send it to the bluetoothd. I feel this will unnecessarily complicate the logic in the kernel.

When the Sampling_Period is set to 0xFF, the controller sends only one advertisement report per monitoring period [2]. So, we need to rely on the MSFT_Monitor_Device controller event for RSSI and timeouts tracking. In other cases, as the bluetoothd receives more than one advertisement report, it can perform RSSI and timeouts tracking.

the kernel has to buffer events related to advertising reports and inquiry results already anyway. That is just the cost of business and it is the job of the kernel to do exactly that.

I do not want to dumb down the kernel into a vendor extension passthrough since that is always going to come back and bite you. My current thinking is actually that unless Start Discovery triggers a discovery procedure, device that are monitored, should get its own report out path via mgmt.

So the kernel would send Advertising Monitor Device Found Event (most likely with a flag for tracking started) and subsequence events of the same type whenever it gets updated. I mean, the kernel should track the state when a device is tracked anyway. It has to keep track of these things. In case of power down or reset or anything, the kernel needs to generate the Device Lost event to keeps this all in sync. Otherwise userspace is left to figure out what happens. We can not have that. This is similar to when a process dies, the kernel cleans up all open file descriptors. That is the basic paradigm that we have enforced with mgmt. If bluetoothd dies or restarts, we can get back to a state where we now all the details without having to hard reset hardware.

One way to lock at this is always from the point of something that is not bluetoothd. Any other user of mgmt API needs to be sound and have a good API contract as well. Kernel APIs that are only designed with one daemon in mind are awful and cause major problems along the road.

That all said, we can do this as above, but I would explore the option of doing it with my proposal and really focus on completely offload of the monitoring the controller.

Marcel
