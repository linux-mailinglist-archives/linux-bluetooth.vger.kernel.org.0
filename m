No, it's not an optimization for my particular setup, but more
generally for CPU load. I thought that it might be better not to run
advertisement code too frequently. But I guess that lower values
should also be OK, e.g. 100 ms or 50 ms. There is one "issue" with
that, though.... Now, the advertisement packet will be sent one
interval after the advertisement was enabled. If that's indeed an
issue, it can be fixed by calling the callback function in the moment
when the timer is armed.

In the previous implementation, the le_set_ext_adv_enable_complete()
function was called after advertisement was enabled in order to send
LE meta packages to devices which have enabled scanning. But this code
was run only once. I thought that we can reuse this logic to send LE
meta packages every interval time. That's why I've renamed this
function, so the name will be more descriptive (it's not enable
complete callback anymore). And in order to provide compatibility with
new sygnature, I've added ext_adv and btdev variables.

Maybe I will briefly describe the previous implementation. There are
two possible cases for sending and receiving advertisements: a) device
A (B, C, ...) enables advertisement and then device Z enables
scanning; b) device Z enables scanning and then other devices enable
advertisement. So, in previous implementation, the LE meta packets
have been sent to devices with enabled scanning from devices which
have enabled advertisement either when the scan was enabled (in device
Z) or when the advertisement was enabled (in device A, B, C ...). The
removed code corresponds to the case of enabling scanning. It's not
required any more, because now advertising is governed by the devices
A, B, C by running advertisement logic every interval time (in the
original patch, every 200 ms, but that can be changed to lover
values).

To be honest I'm not sure what about scan_pa(). Maybe that logic
should also be moved to some timer callback and should be governed by
the A, C, B, ... devices? I would have to read more about sync in the
BLE spec.

Arek
