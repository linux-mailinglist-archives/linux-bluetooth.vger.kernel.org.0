This patch would completely break devices with buggy HFP profile
support.

Also this patch disallow usage of HSP when both HSP and HFP are
supported.

I'm against this change as it disallow to use HSP and HFP simultaneously
with hsphpfd daemon. With hsphfpd daemon it is working with non-buggy
headsets.

Also in pulseaudio we have more bug reports that HFP is does not work
(even when advertised), but HSP is working fine.

If you have a broken headset as you described in commit message, then
please add some quirk for it. But do not disallow usage of HSP / HFP for
all devices including non-broken ones, just because you have one broken
device.
