Hi All,

Thanks Alain and Szymon for chiming in.

Doing a through-out API revamp is definitely worth considering.
However, I'd like to point out the fact that these error messages will
likely be applicable even after API revamp, since the majority of the
error codes are based on errno returned by the kernel.
Another comment was on the format of error return. I'd like to hear
your feedback on how we present errors in D-Bus return. The two
options that we have on the table is (1) string form of error
description (2) string form of uint16 error code.  (1) is more
extendable while (2) is easier to be processed by the client.

Regards,
Miao
