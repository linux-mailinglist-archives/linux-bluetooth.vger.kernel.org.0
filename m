my memory is getting old and even while I actively worked on 4.2 and 5.x specs, I keep forgetting details.

So here is the thing from the latest specs for the LE Enhanced Connection Complete event:

C24: Mandatory if the Controller supports Connection State and either LE Feature (LL Privacy) or LE Feature (Extended Advertising) is supported, otherwise optional if the Controller supports Connection State, otherwise excluded.

That means that when either of these features are listed as supported, we unmask the event. Keep the LE Connection Complete also unmasked since the spec is clear that if both are unmasked the “enhanced” version shall be used.

Maybe introduce an use_enhanced_conn_complete() macro.

Regards

Marcel
