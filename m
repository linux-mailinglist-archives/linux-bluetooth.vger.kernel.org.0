 They can do localized changes. Defaults are meant to be in /usr/lib/ actua=
lly. And override is also meant that an /etc file can fully replace an /usr=
/lib file.

If I interpret this correctly, the reason against this proposal isn't
really about the location of the conf (/usr vs /etc), but rather that
BlueZ intends to use the main.conf already as an override (so there is
no need for another override), is that right?
