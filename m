Hi Marijn,

Thanks for your inputs. Having a separate SetAbsoluteVolume API that
blocks (until the peer acknowledges the change) is certainly more
featureful than this patch's approach, since the media player can
decide what to do with pending SetAbsoluteVolume calls and have the
flexibility to handle the situation. However, there is also a value in
the shorter term approach that this patch without any changes in the
media player part and has been tested to solve the janky slider issue
in Chrome OS. I believe that this would also solve PulseAudio's
similar janky slider issue for the short term.

If Marijn and Luiz are okay with the shorter term approach first, I
will continue updating this patch according to Luiz's comments, but
otherwise I will abandon this patch in favor of the separate
SetAbsoluteVolume API that Marijn will provide.
