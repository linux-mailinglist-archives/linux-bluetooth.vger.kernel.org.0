Great work ! Unlike the actual maintainers who don't even bother to read
bug-tracker anymore or use ready fixes for their code that they themselves
don't care about, it seems.

However, I doubt that even a scrupulous maintainer would ever allow that many
dedicated workaround options instead of one, in style of usbcore, usbhid and
snd-hda-intel even though they all use inconsistent schemes of their own. A
more reasonable approach would be passing model=vendorID:productID:<"model">
space-separated (to allow several dongles) override pairs with each having a
bunch of quirk-hacks associated (as snd-hda-intel) on it,
quirks=vendorID:productID:<comma separated list of all quirks> space-separated
pairs (as usbcore/usbhid) or both. But that means doing even more work that can
be ignored or offhandedly dismissed for code that was written without enough
foresight for it in the first place.
