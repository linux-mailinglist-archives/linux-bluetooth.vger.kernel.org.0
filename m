Hi Luiz,

One more question. Once we upgrade our device to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with
BlueZ 5.53, we'll test "Service Changed Indication". Is GATT cache
related to "Service Changed Indication"? If they are related, then I
guess we should turn on the GATT cache in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf?
Right now, the GATT cache is turned off in our device.

Thanks,
Kenny

 the temperature UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received th=

 is returned to the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavi=
or as the bluetooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/blueto=
oth/[BT_MAC]/cache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files=
 in the folder. That means the disabled cache seems working.
