that nothing else is happening right now. It backstabs the actual AVDTP and A2DP implementation.

Lets extend btinfo with all sort of capabilities. Make the av portion just one of. I want to remove the multitudes of test utilities anyway. We have to many tiny utilities that are just scattered around and avinfo is just one of them.

This needs a bit thinking, but pretty much simple things like this:

	btinfo local
	btinfo avdtp <remote_bdaddr>

We can create a module handling system so that you can easily links existing tiny utilities into one.
