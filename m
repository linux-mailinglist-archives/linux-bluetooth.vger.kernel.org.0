I do not need to parse and interpret all AT commands. Telephony commands
does not have to parsed and interpreted. They can be forwarded to
telephony agent (if connected) OR replied with ERROR as a result that
command is not supported.

Why? Codec negotiation is part of SLC, but codec can be changed prior
opening SCO connection.

How my architecture failed? What to address?

I implemented it in my prototype and it is working. So I do not
understand your point.

I'm not disagreeing with this.

I can say exactly same. I'm not interested in any certification, I do
not see reason to care about it. Pulseaudio does not have any and is the
de-facto standard way how to use bluetooth audio on Linux.

Ok, I will start a separate thread.

It is not separate issue. It is one of the main issues. If ofono is not
going to support HSP then there is absolutely no reason why to use ofono
and extend it to support a new features which currently do not support
(like CSR codecs which are in both HSP and HFP profiles). Basically
without it ofono is unusable for handling bluetooth audio on Linux
desktop.
