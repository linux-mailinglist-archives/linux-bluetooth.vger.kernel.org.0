Well, it is a bit of a definition thing. The ti-st (the older driver)
stands for shared transport, so sharing multiple things over the same
line, by dispatching the TLV structures accordingly to the relevant
protocol drivers and at that point you say that some type values are
Bluetooth, some are GNSS, some are generic power management + fw
download.
AFAIK using any approach based on the now-removed ti-st driver, no
bluetooth would be needed in kernel for using GPS. How could something
be called
"bolted on top of Bluetooth" if Bluetooth is not required.

But then there are devices with some type values which provide
functionality related to Bluetooth. For those the h4_recv_pkt
infrastructure is there. And this happens to be also useable for the
jobs done by the ti-st driver. So it could be obsoleted and
now removed. Probably this h4_recv_pkt stuff could also be used for
other non-bluetooth-related stuff.

So it is a definition thing if either say regarding that TLV structure:
- everything is Bluetooth
- some type values are some Bluetooth vendor channels.
- these vendor channels include GNSS/FM/whatever
or 
- some type values are Bluetooth
- some other are GNSS/FM/whatever
- some are some kind of generic management (firmware download, power
  management).

The further is what is reflected by the hci_ll approach, the latter is
what is used by the ti-st approach.

It is a bit of a headache to forcefully draw in Bluetooth stuff, but as
I am using Bluetooth anyway for keyboards, I am not eager to venture
on any revive of the ti-st stuff to avoid that Bluetooth dependency

Andreas
