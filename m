Yes, that's right.

It will first be tested in Chrome OS with CRAS as the battery provider
from HFP (I am working on it too). I guess PulseAudio can then follow
along so Linux desktops can get headphones batteries in the UI. Then,
as Luiz suggested, batteries from HID will be parsed directly from
within bluetoothd (a TODO, not blocking the progress of the API).

Thanks for the review. I will update the patches based on your and
Luiz's feedback.
