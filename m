I would really love some explanation why can't the driver know under
what mode the controller is when it gets probed, because to me we
cannot accept a driver that only works under certain condition after
the boot and in case it is really impossible, can't even power cycle
it to get it back to cold boot stage???

Also the criticism here should be directed to the vendor, how long
have we been discussing problems in the QCA driver? And the only thing
I see coming our way are work-arounds of the problems, the address not
being unique coming from the firmware itself and when provided via DT
the address is in the wrong byteorder and now that the driver must
communicate the firmware on shutdown in order to get it working
properly on the next boot.
