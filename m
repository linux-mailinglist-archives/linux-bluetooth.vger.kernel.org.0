You might want to look at ready made pairing tools, such as bt-agent in
bluez-tools:
https://github.com/khvzak/bluez-tools

This is an example of using static pincode with unattended pairing:
https://github.com/hadess/CHIP-bluetooth-speaker/blob/master/setup.sh#L73

The bt-agent pin code file can accommodate using bluetooth addresses,
so something like:
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF *
in the pin code file should work.
