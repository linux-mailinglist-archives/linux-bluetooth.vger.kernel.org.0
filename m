Well, to me it looks very similar to those resouses we could manage
with the mmc pwrseq, for SDIO. It's also typically the same kind of
combo-chips that moved from supporting SDIO to PCIe, for improved
performance I guess. More importantly, the same constraint to
pre-power on the device is needed to allow it to be discovered/probed.

Therefore, I think it would be worth having a common solution for
this, rather than a solution per subsystem or even worse, per device.

Unfortunately, it looks like Peter's email is bouncing so we can't get
an update from him.

Kind regards
Uffe
