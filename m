thx for this

BTW & JFYI: regzbot will automatically use the mail's subject as title
by default, so it seems in this case that "#regzbot title:" is superfluous.

Well, I'd be a bit more careful here, as reverting commits after so much
time easily can cause other regressions.

Anyway, the main reason why I write this: I'm currently traveling and
only took a very quick look into this, but a fix for a deadlock for
RFCOMM sk state change was posted last year already:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20211004180734.434511-1-desmondcheongzx@gmail.com/

It seems it never went anywhere, unless I'm missing something. Is that
maybe the same problem or somehow related?

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
