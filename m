I'm not sure how you would like to prevent that, we could in theory
attempt to authorize every single profile before connecting, just like
it is done for legacy, but Im sure system would not be asking the user
what profiles to connect so they just end up trusting the device,
alternatively we could make ConnectProfile to work also for LE so you
can provide a UUID and nothing else would be exposed, but note that
this guess on the AD may actually be wrong and the device may end up
malfunctioning.

Well that doesn't make my point moot, let's say we do enable
connecting by UUID and the application try to connect HoG, it could be
a malicious application trying to eavesdrop what the user is typing,
so this problem of malicious goes both ways Im afraid, besides the
performance penalty that one would have if we need to transport HID
over D-Bus.

More applications could be involved and then this all becomes a mess
if they have to fight over AllowInternalProfiles, so instead of using
a theoretical example we better find real apps and devices where
conflicts happens and work out case by case, adding ConnectProfile
should actually fix most of them if there is a single profile involved
by we could also thing about an alternative to connect multiples.
There is also the possibility of exposing the btd_service as objects,
I've actually had this implemented for the car industry, that way
AutoConnect property could actually be controlled on a per service
basis instead of having just one switch for everything.
