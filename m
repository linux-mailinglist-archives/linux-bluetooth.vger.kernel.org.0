 was not accepted. I agree that once the code is stable, most of the releas=
e reasons may become useless. However, the reason code "4 - Monitor already=
 exists" may still happen. If more than one application creates monitors fo=
r the same pattern but with different RSSI parameters, BlueZ merges those m=
onitors and sends it to the kernel as controllers do not accept monitors wi=
th the duplicate patterns. So, if RSSI parameters do not overlap with the e=
xisting monitors, BlueZ cannot merge such monitors and hence needs to relea=
se it. This error code will help applications to capture such scenarios and=
 update the RSSI parameters accordingly on the fly.

> All monitors are exposed on org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1 interface and=
 applications can check all monitors on that interface. However, multiple a=
pplications adding monitors with the same pattern won't be a common case. S=
o, it will be an overhead to check all other monitors while creating a new =
monitor every time. BlueZ anyway updates the RSSI if there is an overlap of=
 the RSSI parameters. The failure case would occur only when there is no ov=
erlap. So I feel providing a release reason along with a Release() method c=
all would rather be an optimised approach and the application can read thro=
ugh all other monitors only if BlueZ notifies of a conflict. Let me know wh=
at you think about this.

If I got you right you want the daemon to check if there are any
conflicts for the application and if there is than call Release with
the error code, but still we don't inform what the conflict is or
rather what is the RSSI that can be used to resolve the conflict which
comes back to my initial response that this should be resolved by the
daemon somehow and if the application is not happy with the resulting
RSSI then it just unregister which should make this less error prone.
