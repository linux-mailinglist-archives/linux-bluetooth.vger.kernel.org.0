Thanks Luiz, that makes sense and would explain why it ignores the
sensor's advertisements at pretty regular 11 second intervals. And
again, I don't want to keep bugging you guys but my last question is,
is there any issue using the MGMT api in conjunction with the normal
DBus BLE api's? For that matter if I end up having to go to the hci
level can that be mixed as well or will they step on each other
somehow? I'm envisioning putting the normal, "connected" sensors using
the DBus api calls (for scanning, connecting, receiving characteristic
data) in one thread and the beacon devices in a completely separate
thread, both running independently and using different api's (though
possibly sharing some data). If that's just not going to work it'll
help to know up front and I can look at alternatives. Thanks again,
chris
