+Luiz and +Johan -- I think I had you in the cc: before but, as Marcel
said in earlier email, what are your thoughts on where this belongs in
userspace?

I'm reluctant to plop this in "Add Device" because that happens before
profile connection and that's when we determine whether the connection
should be wake capable.

Here's the contents of my last email:
 Hi all,

 Reviving this thread to talk about how we should handle "set wake
 capable".  For a more general implementation, we could rename this to
 "Set Connection Params". It could be extended for other connection
 parameters in the future.

 i.e.
 enum conn_params_type {
   SET_WAKE_CAPABLE,
 };

 struct conn_param {
   uint8_t type;
   uint8_t value;
 };

 struct set_conn_params {
   bdaddr_t addr;
   uint8_t count;
   struct conn_param values[];
 };

 Thoughts?

 Abhishek
