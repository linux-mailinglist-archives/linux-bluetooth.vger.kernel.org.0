so I have been looking at this again and yes, we should just put IRKs in the resolving list for devices that we also put in the whitelist. And we only use the whitelist for background scanning.

This means I would only focus on enabling background scanning. For everything else, we can just let the host do the resolving.

	Enable passive scanning
		-> Enable resolving list if privacy device in whitelist
		-> Set Scan Parameters
		-> Set Scan Enable

	Disable passive scanning
		-> Set Scan Disable
		-> Disable resolving list if enabled

And when updating the whitelist, also add update the resolving list with needed entries for the whitelist. This means if the privacy enabled device goes into the whitelist, add the IRK to the resolving list. Remove all no longer needed IRKs.

Regards

Marcel
