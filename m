I think that is all basically correct. I switched the Boolean bit-sense  such that the boolean parameter is “remote” on the send and “local” on the receive.

And most importantly, your last point is an emphatic yes....    you will need to import your own device key to the key ring if you want to talk to your own builtin servers.  The one exception will be nodes that have called “Create()” which are generating brand new mesh networks with themselves as unicast 0001.
