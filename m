Indeed, but on the other hand 4.4.1.1 says that:

"The application-layer security on the Configuration Server model shall use the
device key established during provisioning."

So it doesn't make any sense for a server model to accept messages encrypted
with remote device key. I think the only situation where a message using remote
device key should be accepted is processing responses directed to a local
client.

In the end, I agree we need to track the 'kind' of a device key... But, I think we
actually need to expose the local/remote distinction to the application, as an
(boolean?) argument of DevKeyMessageReceived. This is because foundation models
aren't the only models that are allowed to use device-level security.  Also,
you mentioned earlier that the daemon will not expose APIs for all
configuration client operations.

And what about this then?

Because of the above, I don't think it's correct to always (automatically) use
remote device key if one is known.

If the previous comment about an additional argument makes sense, it would also
make sense to add it to DevKeySend.

Note that the Composition Data Page 0 indicates a *minimum* CRPL size. A
node is free to use a longer list.

So if I read this right, the plan is to allow the application to declare CRPL
size during CreateNetwork/Join procedure?

Got it. Thanks for the additional details.
