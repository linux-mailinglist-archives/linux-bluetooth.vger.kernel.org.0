I'm working on a Raspberry Pi device that performs periodic BLE =
discovery and tries to connect to multiple devices. Most of the times =
this goes fine but especially in BLE heavy environments every now and =
then it fails because it says that the device is not found. I have been =
debugging this issue for a few weeks now and it comes down to this:

   =E2=80=A2 Connect to DBus to start the discovery
   =E2=80=A2 Devices are found, interfacesAdded callbacks are made, =
everything looks fine
   =E2=80=A2 Stop discovery
   =E2=80=A2 Directly some devices are removed by the interfacesRemoved =
callback
   =E2=80=A2 My code does not get the device it searches for -> unhappy =
user

What happens under the hood is that DBus removes all devices from it's =
cache that have been indicated by Bluez as being Not connectable. I.e. =
there is no use in keeping them around, you can't connect to them =
anyway. But... this is not true for the device I'm looking for. It is =
marked as Not connectable incorrectly.
So to chase down the problem I create a btmon dump which shows indeed =
that the device is reported to be Not connectable after having received =
a SCAN_RSP:

> HCI Event: LE Meta Event (0x3e) plen 38 #73 [hci0] 34.359921

But all ADV_IND PDU's before that clearly indicate that the device is =
connectable, it is only after this SCAN_RSP that it is reported as Not =
connectable:

So I am heavily doubting whether the Linux kernel code has a bug in =
handling the SCAN_RSP. Please look at this part of the kernel:=20

=
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/48b1320a674e1ff5de2fad8606bee38f724=
594dc/net/bluetooth/hci_event.c#L6326

It sets the NOT CONNECTABLE flag by default for a SCAN_RSP and will =
overwrite it with any flags it has received with a previous ADV_IND. But =
it does not seem to take into account that in BLE heavy environments the =
previous ADV_IND might be of a totally different device. So every now =
and then it will enter the first path where it will just report the =
device with a NOT_CONNECTABLE flag. Or am I missing something here?=
