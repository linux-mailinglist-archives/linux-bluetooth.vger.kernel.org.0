My concern is that adopting DeviceInRange(object device) will require
an application to issue following D-Bus calls to read properties
including AdvertisingData, RSSI, Tx power(it may be included in
AdvertisingData) and perhaps a new property RawAdvertisingData. Given
these calls reach bluetoothd, the values of these properties may have
changed, so the reading no longer presents the exact values associated
with the DeviceInRange() event. How do we get around this without
providing the actual values along with DeviceInRange?

Since a client that cares about that device, can just monitor the object pr=
operties that we will keep updating as we find the device again. So if the =
RSSI, TxPower or even the advertising data changes, the client will be info=
rmed by a PropertiesChanged signal.
In the case where RSSIs thresholds are not enforced, my original
thought was that DeviceInRange and DeviceOutOfRange do not make lots
of sense, since the terms "InRange" and "OutOfRange" implies RSSI
checks. Also DeviceOutOfRange won't be called in this case, since no
timer was given. Unless you see this differently?
In the case where RSSIs thresholds are provided, using only
DeviceInRange and DeviceOutOfRange makes sense.

DeviceFound() and DeviceLost() sound good to me. Are you suggesting
having two properties, one for HighRSSIThreshold and
HighRSSIThresholdTimer and one for LowRSSIThreshold and
LowRSSIThresholdTimer, so that DeviceFound() is called only if
HighRSSIThresholdAndTimer exists, and DeviceLost() is called only if
LowRSSIThresholdAndTimer exists?

This was close to what I proposed earlier where the thresholds and the
filtering conditions are provided upon function calls, and Luiz
suggested adopting advertising API's way. Given that we may want to
provide what Android provides at some point, having a dict to host
filtering conditions may not be sufficient. If we'd like to have AND
logical relation applied among filtering conditions within a filter,
we basically need to change the signature here. For instance, an
application would like to look for advertisements matching service
UUID 0x1234 AND 0x5678 in Manufacturer data. Having filtering
conditions defined as properties make this possible by adding another
property later without changing the function signature.

I'd like to raise the same concern that I had in previous meetings.
Given that we plan to have SW filtering first and then offload the
filtering to the BT controller, there may be  logical relations
infeasible by HCI extensions. Should we influence this API by the
capabilities of HCI extensions? I guess the answer is not, and that
means bluetoothd needs to be sophisticated enough to determined the
filtering conditions send to kernel for the first tier filtering and
performs the second tier filtering itself.

Again, this was close to what I proposed earlier where the thresholds
and the filtering conditions are provided upon function call. Please
see my above comments on why I think this may not be sufficient.
