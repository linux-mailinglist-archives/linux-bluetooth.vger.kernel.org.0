This actually hasn't taken long to bite us: while the driver does work,
we get error messages early on before the firmware is loaded.
(In hindsight, I probably should have waited a few days before sending
this...)


My current workaround is to return EPROBE_DEFER until we can find a
netdev with a known name in the init namespace, but that isn't really
something I'd consider upstreamable for obvious reasons (interfaces can
be renamed or moved to different namespaces so this is inherently racy
and it's just out of place in BT code)

That makes these two patches on their own rather useless as well, so
unless one of you have an idea that's less ugly I'd guess just dropping
this is the way to go, as much as I dislike the idea of adding more
non-upstream code than we already have :(

Thank you both for your time, the replies have been very helpful and
I'll remember for next time I try to submit something!

And if you have a suggestion, I'll be happy to do some legwork to clean
this mess, so feel free to ask :)


Thanks,
