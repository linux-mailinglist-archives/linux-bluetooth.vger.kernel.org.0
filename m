Ive attempted 5 restart with 5.17.0-0.rc6.109.fc37.x86_64, my headset
was able to reconnect every single time without any problem. The only
think that was a little bit strange was that it reconnects two
normally, once from gdm and then another time when gnome is loading,
but I assume it is normal nowadays since it appears when switching
session pipewire unregisters its audio endpoints.

Perhaps it is some race that depends on how bluetoothd is being
started or something.
