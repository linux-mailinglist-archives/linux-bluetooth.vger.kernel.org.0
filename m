Hi Pali,

> Used by who? Gateway role is fully broken and client (hfp) role is used

I guess that depends on your perspective.  I've already pointed out that 
the desktop 'AG' use case was never something we needed to implement. 
If you want to fix oFono to do that, great.  If you want to write your 
own daemon to do this, also great.

Why is oFono at fault for this?  Genuine question.  What are the 
roadblocks to mSBC support?

At the time this was all done in software.  Alternatively, the hardware 
was directly wired between the sound card / modem and the bluetooth 
chip.  So just opening the SCO socket was enough.

So how do you negotiate the 'AgentCodec'?  Does BlueZ expose this 
information?  If so, how? SCO socket option or ...?

Isn't the MTU obtained from the SCO socket itself?  How is oFono at 
fault here?

This seems to be a kernel / device driver / firmware  issue and should 
be solved at that level.

There are no plans to do this at the moment.
