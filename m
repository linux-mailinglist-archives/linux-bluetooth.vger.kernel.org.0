That wouldn't solve it, the point is to avoid one user causing problems
for another logged in user. If both users are in the audio group, which
they'd likely be to be able to use the computer, they'd be able to
cause problems to each other.

I haven't looked at the code in depth, but I would expect property
types to be checked before being exported, rather than relying on the
original dbus type matching the expected export type, this sort of
thing.
