Hi Abdul,

we did also see this bug.

Following was observed:
5.48 	ControllerMode =3D le 	We never get Advertising Flags =3D 0x06 runnin=
g
5.52 	ControllerMode =3D le 	After reboot: Advertising Flags =3D 0x02 -> sy=
stemctl restart bluetooth -> Advertising Flags =3D 0x06

It seems to be that during first startup something goes wrong. We did not i=
nvestigate further but also need to have this fixed.

@Community: Is there a fix available or planned?

Best Regards
Jan

Subject: Incorrect advertise flags in bluetooth beacon using BlueZ


Using nRF Connect android application, I'm getting incorrect advertise flag=
s in bluetooth beacon using BlueZ I have tried on two bluez versions i.e 5.=
48 and 5.52.

I have set ControllerMode to "le" in main.conf. Using bluetootctl, when I t=
urn on the advertisement using command "advertise on", I get 0x02 advertise=
ment flag. Which means "BR/EDR Not Supported" (Bit 2) is not set.
Now, if i restart the bluetooth service, and turn on the advertisement agai=
n, I get 0x06 advertisement flags.

Here is my main.conf
