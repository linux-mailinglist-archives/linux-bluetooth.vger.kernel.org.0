My thought was that the number of monitor slots may not be fixed for
different extensions, so the idea was to have one-time handles which
will not be reused once a monitor was removed. If reusing the slots is
a preferable approach, given that Android and Microsoft extensions use
uint8 for indexing filters, we can use either uint16 or uint32 as the
index. I will put uint16 for now.

Nice catch. I will add them in v3.

There was a comment made in the past discussion where we can introduce
a new setting(s) in the returned supported_settings of
MGMT_OP_READ_INFO command to indicate the features such as
MGMT_SETTING_HW_FILTERING . But given that there can be multiple
extensions, it may be preferable to have a separate command which
should be extendable.

Thanks,
Miao
