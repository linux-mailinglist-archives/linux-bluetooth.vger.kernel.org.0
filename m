so the spec is unclear in case of HCI transport. It could be stipulated that CVSD is also possible. However it is not practical since the controller would have to re-encode in case a different air codec is used. The reality is that all “legacy” devices decided for CVSD air codec and PCM host codec.

Going into this direction of allowing CVSD as host codec is just a waste of time.

The case when it is not CVSD, alaw and ulaw is pretty clear written in the spec. Both have to be transparent. I think that the spec and the assigned numbers document is not really clear in specifying which of the Coding_Format fields apply when HCI transport is used vs external channel.

I would really assume that when the host is running the codec, then it is transparent. When the codec is offload to the controller, then the host transport is Linear PCM.

So you I would plan for CVSD<->CVSD<->PCM, Transparent<->{mSBC,LC3}<->PCM, Transparent<->Transparent<->{mSBC,LC3} for the SCO/eSCO cases.

Marcel
