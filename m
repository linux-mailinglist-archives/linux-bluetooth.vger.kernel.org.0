From a D-Bus client perspective, I'd argue that it requires much more
work for an application to register the monitoring job on one
interface. For the case where the device exists already, the
application needs to listen to the device interface for multiple
PropertiesChanged signals (AdvertisingData, RSSI, TxPower,
ManufacturerData, ServiceData and AdvertisingFlags) where these
signals could arrived earlier than the time DeviceFound() got called.
In the case a new device was created, the application also needs to
listen to InterfacesAdded signal and then reads on multiple
properties; by the time the application reads the values, they could
be changed already.
Instead, if we simply provide the parsed dict containing all valid
fields along with RSSI and TX power(this may not be provided), it
eliminates the needs of all above work for the application. I'd like
to highlight that the intention here is to make the life of the
application easier by providing only the matched AD data without the
above extra work. Another thing that I'd like to highlight here is
that we are introducing a new API whose use case is different from
discovery, reporting a device object and reporting an ADV can be
orthogonal. In fact, the reason for providing the device object path
in DeviceFound is to make it easier for the application to take
further action on the device (such as pairing or connection) so that
it doesn't need to figure out which device is associated with the
received ADV. The only downside that I can think of is the case where
the device exists, and this makes DeviceFound call with AD data where
they are emitted via device interface. In the case where the device is
new, there is no duplicate data passing.

I am not sure what you refer to by "company id". For now, the known
use cases don't come along with any specific company information.
