Btw, not sure you if are following the list but I'm working on adding
support for handling multiple CIS to the same peer:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/bluetooth/list/?series=3D739574

That should allow you to set a different CIS ID if you want to use
different sockets for input and output.

Id also would like to discuss how we do some test automation using
pipewire endpoints in the future, we probably want to enable it via
test-runner but we probably need to enable it loading pipewire daemons
etc under the vm that test-runner creates, Frederic started adding
some support but it doesn't look like it loads pipewire so Im not
really sure how it supposed to be loaded:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/tools/test-runner.c=
#n1108
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/tools/test-runner.c=
#n277
