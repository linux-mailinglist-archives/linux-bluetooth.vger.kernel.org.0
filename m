So, the verdict is that the watch isnt acting to spec right?

Why does gatttool work ok, is it a completely different implementation?

I understand if wouldnt be to spec, but would it be possible to make
bluez more resilient to devices not acting to spec?  Android and iOS
work just fine in this regard, so could bluez handle mis-behaving
devices more flexibly?

Do you have any suggestions for things I could try? I looked for
similar lines in the working gatttool log, and it doesnt have anything
like that, seems to send flags 0x00 dlen 9 (instead of 7?)  ... how is
it behaving differently?
