it is not that simple actually. Most profiles define a certain set of parameters and then they try to configure better settings and only fallback to a specification defined default as last resort.

This is an overstatement. I see only one custom codec being used. Unless you have heard from others. However as stated above, I think we need to provide an array of settings that are similar defined to what the HFP spec does. Then we just load the whole set into the kernel.

Good to know. Since for mSBC in theory they need a new alternate settings that wasn’t really available.

Marcel
