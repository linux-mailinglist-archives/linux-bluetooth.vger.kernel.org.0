				Handle[i] (2 Octets)

And we have been using Octet(s) and not octet(s). The document should be pretty much consistent with its style. If you see mistakes, please send patches to correct it.

Advertising content monitoring based on pattern. Lets leave Microsoft out of it.

Pattern_Count please.

Just call it Type and explain in the description that it is the AD Type.

We normally give a range and not “variable length”. I wonder if we should just use a fixed size field here.

Include Monitor_Handle in the return value. The events are not send to the caller and so the caller somehow needs to be able to map that response if they have to.
