However it is not practical since the controller would have to re-encode in case a different air codec is used. The reality is that all “legacy” devices decided for CVSD air codec and PCM host codec.

Well, people are complaining about CVSD quality and there are still lot
of headsets which support only CVSD. Therefore I see a good reason to
try encode/decode of CVSD in software and check if software encoder or
decoder cannot increase this quality. I'm not saying that it can really
improve it but without testing we do not know. And as I know how poor
are some hardware implementations of codecs (but not all) I would not be
surprised if for some bluetooth adapters this can really increase
quality for CVSD transports... But without real tests we do not know.

Yes, for air part it has to be either: CVSD, ALAW, ULAW or TRANSPARENT.
So all other additional codecs use transparent on AIR part.

But on local part it can be also any other codec defined in some
assigned number document.

> I think that the spec and the assigned numbers document is not really clear in specifying which of the Coding_Format fields apply when HCI transport is used vs external channel.

It is months ago when I read specification last time, but I think that
at the time when I read it I understood that also CVSD codec may be used
by local part if is supported.

> I would really assume that when the host is running the codec, then it is transparent.

This is truth for "Setup Synchronous Connection". But not for "Enhanced
Setup Synchronous Connection". In "Enhanced" version you can have local
codec for host also "CVSD", also "mSBC" and also any other which adapter
returns in the "local codec" list or in "vendor codec" list. And for
local part in "Enhanced" version this is *not* transparent anymore.

Of course "Enhanced" version support also "transparent" code and behave
like in classic non-enhanced version.

You forgot AuriStream codec which is used and heavily supported by lot
of headsets. Just people do not know that is is supported.

I would really suggest to look at my API for specifying codec parameters
on socket and allow usage of "Enhanced Setup Synchronous Connection".

I do not think it is waste of time. At least it allows doing all kind of
test what adapters support and what is the quality of transport.
