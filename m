In the case where we allow bluetoothd to configure the use of
controller-based features, Enabled_Features can reflect the ones being
used. For instance, if we find a serious regression with
controller-based features, we can opt-in to disable the use of certain
features (a new command would be needed in this case.), and this would
reflect the use of controller-based features. Another case that I can
think of is that there may be more extensions whose features may
overlap, and we may want to allow bluetoothd to choose which one to
adopt, so Enabled_Features would reflect the ones being used.
I will keep Enabled_Features in v5 and continue the discussion.

Nice catch, I will add them in v5.

As discussed, given that an extension, such as Microsoft extension,
does not have a fixed number of allowed monitors and fixed number of
allowed patterns. Any number would be a wrong one. Internally in the
kernel, we may want to set a max to secure the use of memory, but I am
not sure about exposing those internal numbers so that there may be
requests to expose that number to D-Bus clients. But I can see the
benefits of exposing the max where BlueZ can avoid sending MGMT
commands which are sure to be rejected by the kernel. I will add
Max_Handles with value 32 and Max_Patterns with value 8. Please let me
know if you have better values in mind for these two fields (I am
working on MGMT command handlers).

Ack. Please refer to my reply above around Enabled_Features. I was
thinking that we may want to allow bluetoothd to configure the use of
extensions, so I explicitly put Microsoft here.
