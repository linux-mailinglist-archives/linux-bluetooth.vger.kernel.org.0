So if I got you right you are saying that characteristics under the
last 2 services are not listed? But they appeared on the logs:

        Value: 8a430168db5fe9dcd35c8dec46efcb334ffa8

So this informed the remote that there are a total of 11 (8+3)
characteristics in the range of 0x0123-0x0144.

        Value: 885001da299c6a9df1309f43421ece432e9233

And there are 4 characteristics in the range of 0x0145-0x0151. In fact
all the services seem to contain characteristics so if the remote
cannot list them then the problem is on their side, also there are
writes on the handles 0x04xx where there are no services whatsoever,
so this tells me that the remote has a invalid cache even after
performing a discovery and found out there are no services in the
range 0x0152-0xffff:
