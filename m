+Set Runtime Firmware Command
+============================
+
+	Command Code:		0x0057
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Action (1 Octet)
+				Firmware_Length (2 Octets)
+				Firmware (0-65535 Octets)
+	Return Parameters:	Missing_Options (4 Octets)
+
+	This command allows configuration of runtime firmware or patch
+	download setting. Since a vendor specific procedure is required,
+	this command might not be supported by all controllers.
+
+	Possible values for the Action parameter:
+		0	Reset to default driver firmware
+		1	Reset to current or configure new firmware
+
+	When resetting to the default firmware, Firmware_Length shall be
+	set to 0. The system will go back to the original firmware selected
+	by the driver. When resetting to current firmware, Firmware_Length
+	shall also be set to 0. If there has been never specified a new
+	firmware, then a reset to default or current is not different.
+
+	Loading a new firmware can be triggered with the Action 1 and a
+	Firmware specified. The Firmware is a string that would also be
+	used in request_firmware() and has to be NUL terminated. The
+	Firmware_Length field shall include the string length plus the
+	additional NUL byte.
+
+	In the case a driver has no default driver firmware, then an
+	Action 0 will fully reset the device into an unconfigured state.
+
+	When the support for runtime firwmare configuration is indicated
+	in the supported options mask, then this command can be used to
+	set the runtime firmware.
+
+	It is only possible to configure the runtime firmware when the
+	controller is powered off.
+
+	For an unconfigured controller and when Missing_Options returns
+	an empty mask, this means that a Index Added event for the now
+	fully configured controller can be expected.
+
+	For a fully configured controller, the current controller index
+	will become invalid and an Unconfigured Index Removed event will
+	be sent. Once the firmware has been successfully loaded an Index
+	Added event will be sent. There is no guarantee that the controller
+	index stays the same.
+
+	All previous configured parameters and settings are lost when
+	this command succeeds. The controller has to be treated as new
+	one. Use this command for a fully configured controller only when
+	you really know what you are doing.
+
+	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or a
+	Command Status event on failure.
+
+	Possible errors:	Rejected
+				Not Supported
+				Invalid Parameters
+				Invalid Index
