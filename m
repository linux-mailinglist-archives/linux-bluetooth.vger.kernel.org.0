I am leaning towards option 1 since it is a lot easier to read and also handle inside the code. We can add extra flags if default values should be applied.

The one thing that is rather more problematic is that fact that we want to provide tx_power and then we need to know what the tx_power level has been chosen by the controller. In HCI there is no combined command and thus setting the parameters first and then the data is possible.

So maybe one proposal could also be this:

Add Extended Advertising Command
================================

        Command Code:           0x00xx
        Controller Index:       <controller id>
        Command Parameters:     Instance (1 Octet)
                                Flags (4 Octets)
                                Duration (2 Octets)
                                Timeout (2 Octets)
				TX_Power (1 Octet)
				Min_Interval (2 Octets)
				Max_Interval (2 Octets)
        Return Parameters:      Instance (1 Octet)
				TX_Power (1 Octet)


We can implement this command in way that extension with new fields is possible. Not all commands need to be strict in length. Such a created instance is of course off by default.

And then you need to provide the AD with a separate command to activate the instance.

Set Advertising Data Command
============================

	Command Code:		0x00xx
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Instance (1 Octet)
				Flags (4 Octets)
                                Adv_Data_Len (1 Octet)
                                Scan_Rsp_Len (1 Octet)
                                Adv_Data (0-255 Octets)
                                Scan_Rsp (0-255 Octets)
	Return Parameters:      Instance (1 Octet)

This command should only be allowed if Add Extended Advertising is used and most likely also Advertising Data Changed event needs to be added to complete this.

The Flags might share a namespace if that makes sense, but not all are available for both commands.

Regards

Marcel
