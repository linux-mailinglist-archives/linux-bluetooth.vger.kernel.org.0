CSR features (battery status level, ...) and CSR codec selection (e.g.
AuriStream). Also some apple extensions are used in HSP profile.

I saw. But it does not support usage of vendor codecs, like CSR
AuriStream and it does not support CSR extensions, like displaying text
on embedded display.

Denis, if you are not interested in my proposed hsphfpd daemon, how you
want to solve problem with other extensions and other vendor codecs?

Also in my proposed solution it is possible to use HFP profile without
Telephony Agent (ofono). Do you think it is really a good idea to have
strong dependency on ofono just for bluetooth HFP headset?

Also for using ofono with HFP profile is not possible on desktop
computer which do not have any modem as it is hooked to some active
modem.

There is a way to use ofono sim simulator which provide fake modem, but
its setup is hard on desktop and it not automated.

So connecting bluetooth headset in HFP profile with ofono is something
not so easy and not an obvious way.
