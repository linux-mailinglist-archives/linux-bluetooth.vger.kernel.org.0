It seems to work:
$ ./user-on-seat
Active: 1
Active: 0
Active: 1

But the problem occurred while I didn't try any "seat" change.
I just started bluetoothd, obexd and obexctl, then tried to connect to my phone and got:

     connect 24:24:B7:11:82:6C pbap
     Attempting to connect to 24:24:B7:11:82:6C
     [NEW] Session /org/bluez/obex/client/session0 [default]
     [24:24:B7:11:82:6C]# Connection successful

While I'm expecting:

     connect 24:24:B7:11:82:6C pbap
     Attempting to connect to 24:24:B7:11:82:6C
     [NEW] Session /org/bluez/obex/client/session0 [default]
     [24:24:B7:11:82:6C]# [NEW] PhonebookAccess /org/bluez/obex/client/session0
     [24:24:B7:11:82:6C]# Connection successful
