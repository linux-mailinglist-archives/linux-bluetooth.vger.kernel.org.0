Which totally doesn't matter.

Evidently, there are multiple cases in which the controller stops responding
and that must not be a reason for failing the system suspend (that may mean
refusing to suspend after a user has closed a laptop lid or similar).

The controller may not be able to suspend cleanly, but that doesn't matter.

There still is time to recover during system resume and if that fails, it will
just not work going forward and so be it.

Failing system suspend is not an option.  You can do that only in critical
situations.
