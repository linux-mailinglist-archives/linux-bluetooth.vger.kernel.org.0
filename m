Regarding (1) like I said you will need another struct to store the
offset and length for doing the pattern matching but otherwise it is
pretty similar, regarding (2) there is actually a real benefit that we
could in the future drop the eir_ helpers and unit test just the bt_ad
including pattern matching as well.

Not sure I follow you here, that doesn't seem to be about the parsing
of the AD but the creation of an object for matching, not sure we need
that since you can probably just pass a stack variable directly, in
any case you would need a free as well.

You may have more than one entry of the same type, anyway if we do
have something like bt_ad_new_with_data that means we can pass it
around and not have to reparse it when doing custom filtering. We
might as well have a callback that does get called every time there is
a match, also it may be possible to pass all the pattern at once in
which case we can pass the pattern which matched along with the data
thus having the call it multiple times for each monitor.
