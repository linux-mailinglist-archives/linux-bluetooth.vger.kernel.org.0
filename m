Yes, I remember that discussion. The rationale was ability to catch
bugs in the application, and get rid of created, but effectively
unusable nodes.

Indeed, although I don't think it's necessary to introduce a "busy"
state...

In case of Leave(), this call removes the node anyway, so what I think
would suffice is to check whether the node still exists when
JoinComplete reply arrives, to avoid freeing the node twice (causing
SEGV).

void node_finalize_new_node(struct mesh_node *node, struct mesh_io *io)
{
	if (!node)
		return;

	if (!l_queue_find(nodes, match_simple, L_UINT_TO_PTR(node)))
		return;

    // ...
}

This would allow the application to call Leave *before* sending a reply
to JoinComplete.

As for Attach(), I also think it should be legal to call it before
replying to JoinComplete. The worst thing that can happen is that
application successfully attaches, then replies to JoinComplete with an
error. This would simply remove the node, and the application would be
promptly detached.

Unfortunately, not all main loops have API to schedule "idle" calls,
i.e. calls executed when the loop doesn't have anything better to do.

I know that both ELL and Glib do, but AFAIR Qt does not (it uses timers
with timeout set to 0, if I'm not mistaken), and Python's asyncio
doesn't either.

I don't think requiring a specific sequence of dbus messages is a good
idea :(
