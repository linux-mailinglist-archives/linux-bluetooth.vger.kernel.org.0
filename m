Again, it's bluez' prerogative that serial profiles don't automatically
get a serial device node attached.

Either you need to create the rfcomm device node manually, or you need
to jump through the same hoops many apps do, using SDP to find the
RFCOMM port on the remote device, and connecting to that port using an
AF_BLUETOOTH socket.

The cups backend in the bluez sources does both of those things.

I don't remember how this used to work, but you'll probably only see
something if the printer is visible.

You might be able to get the printer to work by adding:
bluetooth://DC0D309023C7
as a printer in the printer settings of your favourite desktop
environment, if it actually uses SPP.

running the cups backend with:
/usr/lib/cups/backend/bluetooth --get-deviceid bluetooth://DC0D309023C7

should show you whether it can get autoconfigured for CUPS use.
