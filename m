I assume you have a typo on RT instead of CT, is that right? From
qualification point of view anything initiated by a device is
considered a CT role, much like GATT server and client roles, so we
may have instances where both CT and TG are supported simultaneously.

As I mentioned above the qualification tests requires both TG and CT
for things like absolute volume to work as notifications for volume
changes originate from the device rendering the audio/sink not the
source, so the typical association of sink/CT, source/TG is no longer
true and before you ask, yes we have some code and comments leading to
that assumption which we should probably fix at some point so I guess
having the supported events in 2 is probably a good idea, though
notice that it should probably be local and remote events since event
afaik are always originated from the TG role.

When receiving a request our role is TG so I don't see why we would
skip this check, a better way to fix this would be to add the
separated supported events like discussed above so we have the roles
operating independent as they should be.
