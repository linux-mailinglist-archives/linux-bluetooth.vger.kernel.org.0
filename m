Hi Marcel,

From a high level, this looks good for me although I agree, this is an
order of magnitude bigger in terms of scope.  Can you suggest perhaps
an interactive way to deliver this over a period of time, perhaps
prioritizing the BT_DEBUG kernel messages first? :)

Thanks,
Alain

 So far I came up with this:
>
> 1) We want to be able to start btmon -d and btmon-logger -d and then debu=
gging gets enabled in the kernel and bluetoothd and all of them will be inc=
luded in the btmon trace files. So a customer can just create a log files t=
hat includes kernel messages, bluetoothd messages and also HCI traces and i=
f enabled (and supported by the specific hardware) LMP traces.
>
> 2) When enabled in the kernel, then bluetoothd should follow the debug le=
vel. I think it makes no sense if we end up having to restart bluetoothd. E=
specially since bluetoothd also has internally =E2=80=9Cdynamic_debug=E2=80=
=9D like statements that can be switched at runtime (and per statement actu=
ally).
>
> 3) We need an option to disable this and compile it out. Switching on dyn=
amic_debug and extra debug statements for our own =E2=80=9Cdynamic_debug=E2=
=80=9D causes an overhead that we can not really accept. We might even go t=
his far as making it mutually exclusive.
>
> 4) Wherever possible we want debug statements that can be related to the =
given hciX interface index.
>
> 5) There needs to be an option to limit the scope of the debug messages s=
ince otherwise you get lost in the noise.

> 6) I don=E2=80=99t want to touch every BT_DBG statement or debug statemen=
t in bluetoothd. Developers should be able to just add a debug and the rest=
 will be taken care of for them.
