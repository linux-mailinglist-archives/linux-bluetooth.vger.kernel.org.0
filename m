Hi Luiz, Marek,

I have to apologize upfront for prioritizing replying to Luiz' review
of this patch before checking Marek's message in the other mail
thread.  As it turns out my expectation that CT/TG are orthogonal from
the Remote Control and Remote Control Target service is completely
wrong; they are in fact analogous.  That explains all the
misunderstandings thus far.  I will revise this patch and resend it
with the new insights I have right now.

This means that the code in BlueZ currently is correct.
AVRCP_REGISTER_NOTIFICATION will only ever be sent from CT to TG,
supported_events can thus only be defined by whatever the CT service
supports (and implicitly encodes what BlueZ as TG supports; if it is
not supported, the code to add the event to supported_events simply
won't be there).  I have unfortunately lost and cannot find the
specification for older AVRCP versions anymore, but the 1.5 and 1.6.2
spec mention nothing about requiring at least version 0x104 for
Absolute Volume.  This is instead unambiguously clarified in "4.5
AVRCP specific commands": the Absolute Volume event and notification
are mandatory when CATEGORY_2 is reported.  For what it's worth I
think the sink/source distinction I tried to make in previous mails is
instead defined by these categories.

Luiz what do you reckon: is it a quirk of Android to report version
0x103 while also reporting CATEGORY_2, and is it okay to solve this by
removing the version check and enable EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED when the C2
feature is reported by the CT?

Also, sending get_capabilities from target_init doesn't make much
sense.  If session->controller is NULL that means the remote doesn't
have the TG profile and thus can't handle the command?

Marek, I'll omit replying to most of your points after understanding
this finally, for convenience.

It makes sense now: we don't need to separate out *_events between CT

Turns out we can and should base this information on the categories
supported by the CT instead, which _may_ loosely resemble who is able
to be source and sink.

I had a lot of trouble switching around source and sink on two
machines running BlueZ and pulseaudio, even after using Pali's
excellent A2DP codec work.  Tracking down and resolving these issues
took the better part of the weekend and explains why this mail is
late.

There's a proprietary "protocol" called FastStream that allows
bi-directional (SBC) audio streams but I do not have any existing
device to test volume on.  The protocol should work between two
BlueZ+PulseAudio devices but that doesn't represent any conclusive
testing.

A more realistic scenario is swapping around source and sink which
works properly after aforementioned fixes (between two devices with
speakers, running BlueZ+PulseAudio).  As expected merely the
SEP/transport is recreated, the AVRCP connection is not set up again
meaning the capabilities/features must be static.  In other words, we
can't make the distinction between A2DP sink and source profiles in
most of the code here.  We'll have to do with exposing the right
category features right from the get-go.
Other than that it appears absolute volume keeps working properly, at
least on the BlueZ side.  This requires more intricate testing after I
resolve all issues with my A2DP Absolute Volume implementation in
PulseAudio when used in conjunction with codec- and side-switching.

Not really, I have always said that the CT is the sender and in case
of SetAbsoluteVolume the source is the sender. I just never made the
link between CT and the RemoteControl service as explained above.

1.1. CT and TG are abbreviations for the controller and target roles
respectively.

To clarify, I simply wasn't expecting separate services to denote
whether a peer can send or receive a command.  Indeed, it is correct
this way.

I guess we have to assign supported_events before setting up the pdu
handler, or at least before sending anything to the peer (like
get_capabilities in controller_init).

Indeed.  I asked the same question at the beginning of this mail but
want to reiterate it as it is core to the problem I tried to fix back
in January.  The 1.5 and 1.6.2 versions of the spec mention _nothing_
about the version of the peer CT profile.  Instead, absolute volume is
mandatory when the peer CT reports it is a category 2 device.
