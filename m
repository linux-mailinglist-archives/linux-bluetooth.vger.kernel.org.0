The proposal doesn't actually define the location of the .d directory,
the proposal only states that bluetoothd will have the capability to
have a .d directory defined at compile time and used at runtime.
As I mentioned earlier, this is where configurability at build time
will be useful.
For example, for the enterprise distribution that you just mentioned,
BlueZ can be configured to have the stock conf at
/usr/lib/bluetooth/main.conf (locked down), and user/admin overrides
at /etc/bluetooth/main.conf.d.
If I understand your concern correctly, this should solve the problem
with this different configuration file layout. If I misunderstand
something let me know.

Could you elaborate why providing a .d overrides directory isn't
right? I can mention an example use case: BlueZ ships at a distro with
certain values of MinConnectionInterval and MaxConnectionInterval in
the stock configuration. The user realizes that these values don't
work well with the Bluetooth controller hardware, maybe LE keyboards
don't reconnect well. They then want to configure this values, but
don't want to edit the stock conf because maybe it's locked or they
don't want to mess with files provided with the package manager. The
user can then use the override directory to customize the values for
MinConnectionInterval and MaxConnectionInterval to make the keyboard
work.

I think that the proposal solves the use case above. If you think this
is not the right approach, could you elaborate why and suggest an
alternative we can consider?
