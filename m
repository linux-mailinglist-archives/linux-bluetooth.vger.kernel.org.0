Hi! If I understand it correctly, pulseaudio would register itself via
new dbus method and bluez daemon then discover A2DP SEP endpoints
automatically, right? And if that new dbus method does not exist
pulseaudio would know that in system is running old bluez version
without codec switching support. Seems it is perfectly fine solution.
