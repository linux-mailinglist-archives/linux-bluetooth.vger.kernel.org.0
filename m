I don’t know what that is, but it seems that something else in your system is calling hcidump binary. However it is for sure not btmon calling the hcidump binary and you can verify that in the btmon source code.

The hcidump -R functionality is rather useless. If you really want it, then you can get it by opening the monitor socket directly. I really don’t know what you wanted it for.

Regards

Marcel
