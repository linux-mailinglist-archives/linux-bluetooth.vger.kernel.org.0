Log from bluetoothctl

I have recently bought two Bluetooth devices:

 - Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse 3600 (requires confirmation for pairing)
 - Microsoft Surface Keyboard (requires passcode for pairing)

Both devices pair with the system and work fine. However, at random times
(maybe when idling) both devices change their mac-addresses to a new one.

This is a problem, because pairing disconnects, and bluez sees those devices as
new devices. Thus I need to manually repair them and... well, it should not be
like that.

I did make a bit crude python-script that communicates with 'bluetoothctl' and
repairs the mouse whenever it is discovered as a new device. But that does not
work with the keyboard because of the passcode requirement.

I attached some log from 'bluetoothctl'.

Is it possible to detect in the device driver that newly discovered device is
actually the same but with different mac-address and repair it automatically?

Bluetoothctl version is 5.53
