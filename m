Duplication is something that we have to deal with, regardless whether
it's about HID or anything else. As I originally proposed and
reflected in the code, we start with the simplest duplicate
resolution: accepting the first one who registered and ignores the
rest. From BlueZ point of view, clients can feed battery information
and it handles the duplication. From external clients point of view,
they do not know whether there is already another source (provider
from HFP does not know that there is already another provider from
FastPair, for example) so what they do is feed what they have and let
BlueZ handle the duplication. With this behavior defined, I don't
understand why it becomes necessary for BlueZ to extract HID battery
information directly? I *do* think it is a good idea, but I don't
understand why it (extracting HID battery directly by BlueZ) is a
prerequisite to have the battery provider API in place.
