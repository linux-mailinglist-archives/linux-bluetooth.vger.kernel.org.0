Hi Sathish,

So last time around I said, I don’t like it this way. Now I get the same thing again. Can we please stop trying to hack this into the driver like this.

If we now actually start pushing these change into our firmware, then maybe it would be good to give Linux a heads up that this is changing. Intermixing these kind of firmware “modes” is something that should be designed properly. If not, this driver become unmaintainable and we start seeing bugs after bugs for corner cases that are not tested.

The problem you have to address here is not the Intel Read Version command and trying to fit everything into some magic union struct and add if-clauses everywhere. The problem is that we have now 4 combinations of device initialization that we need to handle correctly (and I am including StP here as well).

Let me try to summarize what we have.

	1) Gen 1 ROM patching with maintainer mode and all the fun around it
	2) Gen 2 RAM firmware loading and static structs bootloader and operational
	3) Gen 2 RAM firmware loading with static struct for bootloader and TLV for operational
	4) Gen 3 RAM firmware loading and TLV for bootloader and operational

Is this correct?

We have to realize that btintel_read_version function is no longer usable as it is. It can also not be extended properly.

What we need is a generic btusb_setup_intel that executes the read version (without any helper), runs basic sanity checks and then segways into legacy, static or TLV versions of firmware loading and operational setup.

Of course there are optimization in the logic for 1) and 4) since you know what the operational handling will be. Nevertheless this needs to be changed now before this grows out of control and we still have users that are testing it and reporting back problems.

To achieve this, pick one hardware (say ThP since it is wildly available) and move it to a new btusb_setup_intel_generic() that does what I described above. Test this with 2) and 3) firmwares to ensure we can handle things correctly.

Actually it might be worth while to build a btvirt that allows us to emulate all Intel controllers boot handling. So that we can have automated intel-tester tool to verify that we don’t break things.

Regards

Marcel
