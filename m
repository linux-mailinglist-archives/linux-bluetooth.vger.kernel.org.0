Hi Miao-chen,

> 
> Changes in v4:
> - Change the signature of SupportedMonitorTypes to be array of strings.
> - Fix document formatting.
> 
> Changes in v3:
> - Introduce SupportedFeatures to reflect the features based on

> - Modify SupportedMonitorTypes to list available types of monitors.
> 
> Changes in v2:
> - Rename the interfaces and functions.
> - Adopt the object manager mechanism so that a client can expose
> multiple monitor objects and expect to get notified on whether the
> monitor has been activated or not.
> - Change the contract of DeviceFound so that it is called to indicate
> the starting point of monitoring on a device instead of reporting every
> ADV. In other words, the client is expected to monitor corresponding

can you please at least roughly follow the style regarding the empty lines from the other documents.

Do we actually need this? As noted by Szymon we would expect RegisterMonitor to only return when it successfully active a monitor.

This part we really need to discuss and come to an agreement. I am not in favor of doing these as properties on the monitor object. I would give them as dict to the RegisterMonitor.

My choice of method naming would be RegisterMonitor and UnregisterMonitor.

To be consistent they need to be “patterns-with-or-logic”. And maybe “or-patterns” is just enough.

I would consider shortening this to “controller-patterns”.
