Hi Luiz,

We do update the service after main.conf is changed. 
I agree with Jan's understanding of problem statement here.

Hi Luiz,

what I understood is that at first start of bluez bluetooth service the advertisement flags for "mode" are not set to the correct value, as defined (ControllerMode = le) in main.conf.
If you start the service a second time this flag is correct. For the first time it is always wrong.
This is the same we did see here with our equipment.

Regards
Jan

Are you saying we are not updating the service once main.conf has changed? We don't do that automatically if that is what you are referring to, also if you want to advertise as a beacon/broadcaster and not as peripheral thean us you should use advertise broadcast.
