I am trying this from a different computer today and I find that now the 
Battery Service and Battery Level characteristic are showing up, even on 
the same devices I was reading the other day.  Not sure what's going on, 
but I am investigating further.  At the moment, it seems more likely 
that the problem is either with my devices or with my software.  I just 
wanted to report back to avoid having you all waste your time.  When I 
figure this out, I'll send another update.  Thanks for the help so far.

Ed
