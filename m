Hi Kiran,

so this is conflicting with the patch introducing the ncmd timeout handling.

commit de75cd0d9b2f3250d5f25846bb5632ccce6275f4

    Bluetooth: Add ncmd=0 recovery handling
    
    During command status or command complete event, the controller may set
    ncmd=0 indicating that it is not accepting any more commands. In such a
    case, host holds off sending any more commands to the controller. If the
    controller doesn't recover from such condition, host will wait forever,
    until the user decides that the Bluetooth is broken and may power cycles
    the Bluetooth.
    
    This patch triggers the hardware error to reset the controller and
    driver when it gets into such state as there is no other wat out.

Nowhere in your commit description you are addressing why is this the right to do.

Regards

Marcel
