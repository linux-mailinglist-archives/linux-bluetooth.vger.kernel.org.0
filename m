  btio: Set correct length for getsockopt

When calling getsockopt for BT_ISO_BASE, this initializes the length
argument to the maximum size of the buffer where the bytes are placed.

This fixes the fact that, on a Broadcast Sink, if the BASE discovered
from a Broadcast Source exceeds a certain length, the bytes will be
incompletely read, causing issues when parsing the LTVs.

  shared/bap: Append extra L3 LTVs to BIS config

According to the BAP spec, the level 3 of the BASE contains codec
configuration LTVs specific to each BIS, in addition to the
configuration provided at level 2 (subgroup level) (v1.0.1,
section 3.7.2.2 Basic Audio Announcements).

Currently, when a Broadcast Sink parses the BASE discovered from a
Broadcast Source, level 3 LTV types that are not also present at
level 2 are not included in the final BIS cofiguration, causing
incorrect stream handling. This updates the BASE parsing logic to
consider level 3 LTVs.

is output (for example, if you turn on scanning and then try to write
something to the terminal, the output will be mixed - you will get
something like this:

[JBL T450BT]# h[NEW] Device ****
[JBL T450BT]# he[NEW] Device ****
[JBL T450BT]# hell[NEW] Device ****
[JBL T450BT]# hello[NEW] Device ****

Where "Device ****" is the line that was actually fed to
bt_shell_printf.

This can be reproduced using bluetoothctl and doing "player.list-items"
just before switching music player on the remote device.

This commit discards the item list parsing if the current player has
not created a pending_list_items, i.e. it doesn't start this request.

This reworks transport.select to use a dedicated structure to hold

  adapter: Fix the pending changing flags check

When checking if the new desired device flags are already pending, we
should compare them against the XOR of current flags and desired flags,
i.e. the flags that are going to change.

For example, let's assume the following situation:
- We have a device with `current_flags =3D=3D DEVICE_FLAG_REMOTE_WAKEUP`
(i.e. 1)
- We want to disable the `wake_allowed` property
- `device_set_wake_allowed()` will call `adapter_set_device_flags()`
with `flags =3D=3D 0`
- When in `adapter_set_device_flags()`, we'll have:
  - current =3D=3D 1
  - pending =3D=3D 0
  - flags =3D=3D 0
In this situation `flags =3D=3D (flags & pending)` would not return what
we'd expect.

A "0" for the input MTU passed to the underlying socket is supposed to
indicate that its value should be determined by the L2CAP layer.
However, the current code treats a zero imtu just as if there is
nothing to change.

Introduce rework the code to indicate that the zero imtu is
explicitly requested by the caller for the purpose of auto-tuning and -1
is used as not set value.

  shared/vcp: have only one volume change in flight at a time

If bt_vcp_set_volume() is called again before the previous operation has
completed, the requests get the same change counter, and all except the
first one fail.

Fix by waiting until the current request completes, and if volume was
set again during waiting, send a new request with the latest pending
volume value. In this definition, bt_vcp_set_volume() will skip over
intermediate volume updates if they are done too rapidly.

Send only volume requests that change the value to a different one than
last notification we have seen: in this case the request either fails,
or succeeds and generates a new notification.  In theory this guarantees
we always exit waiting, but safeguard it with a timeout.

Instead, since the BASS Server (BAP Scan Delegator) implementation needs
to reference the bap session, BASS registers bap attached/detached
callbacks with shared/bap.

- After receiving a request from a Broadcast Assistant, the BASS Server
creates a device for the Broadcaster and adds the UUID to probe.

- The service is probed inside the BAP plugin, where a new bt_bap session=

is attached. The service is set as user data beforehand.

- The bt_bap session is notified in the BASS bap_attached callback. The
reference to the service is accessible from the user data.

- The BASS Server takes ownership for the service by setting its user
data. This way, short-lived PA sync will be skipped inside BAP, and the
BASS Server will handle long-lived PA sync and stream configuration.

- When the bt_bap session is removed, it will be notified in the
bap_detached callback.

  btdev: Broadcast EXT_ADV packets based on its interval

Real BLE devices transmit LE advertisement report packages in given
intervals (typically in range between 20 ms and 10.24 s). With current
kernel module Bluetooth stack implementation it is possible that the
first LE meta packet just after enabling scanning will be lost. It is
not an issue for real devices, because more advertisement reports will
be delivered later (in given interval time).

This patch changes optimistic implementation of sending only one LE
meta packets just after enabling scanning to sending LE meta packets
every minimal interval thus emulating what a real controller would do
and will work around the issue of dropping the very first LE meta packet
by the kernel. For direct advertising, the 10ms interval is used to
provide high duty cycle advertising.

  test-runner: Increase amount of RAM available in VM

When using default kernel configuration from Ubuntu 24.04 patched with
the configuration from tester.config, the kernel image is too big to run
on 192M bytes of RAM. As a result the test-runner exits without any
message (because of the "quite" kernel command line option).

  test-runner: Remove the "-nographic" option passed to QEMU

This option causes QEMU to redirect monitor and serial to the terminal,
but also it modifies the terminal settings and clears it before printing
anything. Such behavior might be annoying because it might clear some
warning messages printed before clearing the screen. Since test-runner
disables QEMU monitor and redirects serial to stdio in an explicit way,
the "-nographic" option can be dropped.

  test-runner: Use host CPU when starting VM

When running test-runner on Ubuntu 24.04 with mainline kernel compiled
from Ubuntu default configuration with applied tester.config options,
the QEMU is not able to start the test-runner application due to illegal
instruction. Passing '-cpu host' fixes that issue.

> $ tools/test-runner -k linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage -- tools/mgmt-tester=

> Using QEMU binary /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64
> Using kernel image [...]/linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage

Potential caveat:

In case when the KVM is not available on the host, the QEMU will not
start with the warning:
CPU model 'host' requires KVM or HVF

  test-runner: Allow to use host CPU on demand

The "-cpu host" option for QEMU can not be enabled by default because
our CI system does not have a support for KVM. In order to allow to run
the test-runner on systems where binaries built on the host are not
compatible with QEMU CPU variant, the "--qemu-host-cpu" option will add
the "-cpu host" to the QEMU command line arguments.

  device: Clear pending_flags on error

If setting WakeAllowed, or the device privacy, fails, we may end up in a
situation where `pending_flags` is still set to some `DEVICE_FLAG_*`
values, for example from `device_set_wake_allowed()` or
`adapter_set_device_flags()`.

This can confuse further requests because they'll assume that there is
still a pending request in progress.
