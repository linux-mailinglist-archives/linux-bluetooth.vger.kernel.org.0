That may be an acceptable compromise.  At least there would be exactly
one place to make sure things are aligned.  Perhaps we could also
leave the op-codes in place and create a test that ensures that if
!NULL then op_code =3D=3D index.

Agreed and actually events are less problematic as there is no jump
table to fix up.  As long as it is in the supported events list, then
it works out pretty well, regardless of order...
