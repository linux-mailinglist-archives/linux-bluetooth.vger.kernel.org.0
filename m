Hi Marijn,

Regarding the AVRCP version reported by the phone. There is something
weird going on on android regarding avrcp version and mac addresses
and absolute volume. I discovered couple of whings:
1. galaxy S7 will blacklist some mac addresses to not use absolute
volume for that device (checked it with "adb shell dumpsys
bluetooth_manager"). Changing mac addres of the device to something
other allows for absolute volume to work. For both cases it reports
avrcp version 1.4.
2. xiaomi redmi note 4 will report different avrcp version depending
on mac address. version 1.3 for mac address that galaxy s7 blacklists
and 1.6 for mac address that galaxy s7 does not blacklist. But in both
cases the absolute volume does not work ...
3. xiaomi redmi 8 will not even report that it has "A/V_RemoteControl"
(UUID 0x110E), it just reports that it has only
"A/V_RemoteControlTarget" (UUID 0x110C) but still it can control
volume on my yamaha av receiver and sony headphones and receive volume
updates from them. Very, very wierd.

For the record, to check the avrcp version of the phone I use sdptool
browse command (and to be 100% sure I check also the raw communication
on wireshark). For example this is one of the records reported for
xiaomi redmi note 4 and avrcp version 1.6:
Service RecHandle: 0x10007
Service Class ID List:
  "AV Remote" (0x110e)
  "AV Remote Controller" (0x110f)
Protocol Descriptor List:
  "L2CAP" (0x0100)
    PSM: 23
  "AVCTP" (0x0017)
    uint16: 0x0104
Profile Descriptor List:
  "AV Remote" (0x110e)
    Version: 0x0106

If there is something more I can do to help please let me know. For
example I can send hci snoop logs for specific cases etc.
