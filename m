didn’t you also want to return the selected TxPower? We then also have to agree to allow this command only when the controller is powered.

I was thinking we rename Read Security Information Command and also return these values there. I think it is a bit of waste to introduce yet another command to return controller capabilities.

I would rather return the value right away and only allow it when powered on.
