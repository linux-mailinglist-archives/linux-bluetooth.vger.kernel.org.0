We can perform a pointer comparison if that makes you happy. Anyway I
don't know if you guys have realized already but this is probably
impossible to reproduce with real hardware since the
registration/unregistration comes for other buses no memfault would
hold the thread that long for unplugging and replugging a device on
the bus, vhci is usually only used for emulation/testing/CI, not sure
who got the idea that finding vulnerabilities on our emulator would be
a great feat.

Both blocks do require hci_dev_lock, so if the second block had
acquired the lock isn't it obvious that the first won't execute until
hci_dev_unlock is complete? Anyway after all these discussion Im even
more convinced that the real problem lies in hci_dev_get/hold, after
all references are usually used to prevent the objects to be freed but
in this case it doesn't and no locking will gonna fix that.
