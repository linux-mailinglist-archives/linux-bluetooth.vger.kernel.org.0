Had a look into this, but since the state callback is being registered
during profile-probe, we're not guaranteed that the other services will
have been created yet, so we won't be able to specify which service we
want to subscribe to.
I've removed the AVDTP/AVCTP state callback hook anyway, and switched
over to the existing service-state cb; after moving things around the
overhead turned out to be pretty low, so I'll get it all tidied up and
submit a patch in a couple of days (pending any further feedback).
