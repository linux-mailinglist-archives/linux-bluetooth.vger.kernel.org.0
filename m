while I was writing a patch to show how to use unconfigured state for controllers that donâ€™t support the Read Encryption Key Size command, I was wonder why put this into the kernel in the first place.

I was thinking that essentially userspace can just make the decision to use a controller, or use it in LE only mode or not use a controller at all. So all we need is to collect the security information of the controller and kernel and expose them to bluetoothd.

+Read Security Features Command
+==============================
+
+       Command Code:           0x0048
+       Controller Index:       <controller id>
+       Command Parameters:
+       Return Parameters:      Security_Features (4 Octets)
+
+       This command is used to retrieve the supported security features
+       by the controller or the kernel.
+
+       The Security_Features parameter is a bitmask with currently the
+       following available bits:
+
+               0       Encryption Key Size enforcement (BR/EDR)
+               1       Encryption Key Size enforcement (LE)
+
+       This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
+       a Command Status event on failure.
+
+       Possible errors:        Invalid Parameters
+                               Invalid Index
+
+

I was also considering that we additionally add the ECDH Public Key validation here as supported bits. And in the future even more security related information that we want to enforce. However the enforcement to power on or not use a controller is left to bluetoothd and its main.conf configuration. Thoughts?

Regards

Marcel
