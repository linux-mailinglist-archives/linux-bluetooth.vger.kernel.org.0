-BlueZ D-Bus LE Advertising API Description
-******************************************
-
-Advertising packets are structured data which is broadcast on the LE Advertising
-channels and available for all devices in range.  Because of the limited space
-available in LE Advertising packets (31 bytes), each packet's contents must be
-carefully controlled.
-
-BlueZ acts as a store for the Advertisement Data which is meant to be sent.
-It constructs the correct Advertisement Data from the structured
-data and configured the kernel to send the correct advertisement.
-
-Advertisement Data objects are registered freely and then referenced by BlueZ
-when constructing the data sent to the kernel.
-
-LE Advertisement Data hierarchy
-===============================
-
-Specifies the Advertisement Data to be broadcast and some advertising
-parameters.  Properties which are not present will not be included in the
-data.  Required advertisement data types will always be included.
-All UUIDs are 128-bit versions in the API, and 16 or 32-bit
-versions of the same UUID will be used in the advertising data as appropriate.
-
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.LEAdvertisement1
-Object path	freely definable
-
-Methods		void Release() [noreply]
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			removes the Advertisement. A client can use it to do
-			cleanup tasks. There is no need to call
-			UnregisterAdvertisement because when this method gets
-			called it has already been unregistered.
-
-Properties	string Type
-
-			Determines the type of advertising packet requested.
-
-			Possible values: "broadcast" or "peripheral"
-
-		array{string} ServiceUUIDs
-
-			List of UUIDs to include in the "Service UUID" field of
-			the Advertising Data.
-
-		dict ManufacturerData
-
-			Manufactuer Data fields to include in
-			the Advertising Data.  Keys are the Manufacturer ID
-			to associate with the data.
-
-		array{string} SolicitUUIDs
-
-			Array of UUIDs to include in "Service Solicitation"
-			Advertisement Data.
-
-		dict ServiceData
-
-			Service Data elements to include. The keys are the
-			UUID to associate with the data.
-
-		dict Data [Experimental]
-
-			Advertising Type to include in the Advertising
-			Data. Key is the advertising type and value is the
-			data as byte array.
-
-			Note: Types already handled by other properties shall
-			not be used.
-
-			Possible values:
-				<type> <byte array>
-				...
-
-			Example:
-				<Transport Discovery> <Organization Flags...>
-				0x26                   0x01         0x01...
-
-		bool Discoverable [Experimental]
-
-			Advertise as general discoverable. When present this
-			will override adapter Discoverable property.
-
-			Note: This property shall not be set when Type is set
-			to broadcast.
-
-		uint16 DiscoverableTimeout [Experimental]
-
-			The discoverable timeout in seconds. A value of zero
-			means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in
-			discoverable/limited mode forever.
-
-			Note: This property shall not be set when Type is set
-			to broadcast.
-
-		array{string} Includes
-
-			List of features to be included in the advertising
-			packet.
-
-			Possible values: as found on
-					LEAdvertisingManager.SupportedIncludes
-
-		string LocalName
-
-			Local name to be used in the advertising report. If the
-			string is too big to fit into the packet it will be
-			truncated.
-
-			If this property is available 'local-name' cannot be
-			present in the Includes.
-
-		uint16 Appearance
-
-			Appearance to be used in the advertising report.
-
-			Possible values: as found on GAP Service.
-
-		uint16_t Duration
-
-			Rotation duration of the advertisement in seconds. If
-			there are other applications advertising no duration is
-			set the default is 2 seconds.
-
-		uint16_t Timeout
-
-			Timeout of the advertisement in seconds. This defines
-			the lifetime of the advertisement.
-
-		string SecondaryChannel [Experimental]
-
-			Secondary channel to be used. Primary channel is
-			always set to "1M" except when "Coded" is set.
-
-			Possible value: "1M" (default)
-					"2M"
-					"Coded"
-
-		uint32 MinInterval [Experimental]
-
-			Minimum advertising interval to be used by the
-			advertising set, in milliseconds. Acceptable values
-			are in the range [20ms, 10,485s]. If the provided
-			MinInterval is larger than the provided MaxInterval,
-			the registration will return failure.
-
-		uint32 MaxInterval [Experimental]
-
-			Maximum advertising interval to be used by the
-			advertising set, in milliseconds. Acceptable values
-			are in the range [20ms, 10,485s]. If the provided
-			MinInterval is larger than the provided MaxInterval,
-			the registration will return failure.
-
-		int16 TxPower [Experimental]
-
-			Requested transmission power of this advertising set.
-			The provided value is used only if the "CanSetTxPower"
-			feature is enabled on the Advertising Manager. The
-			provided value must be in range [-127 to +20], where
-			units are in dBm.
-
-
-LE Advertising Manager hierarchy
-================================
-
-The Advertising Manager allows external applications to register Advertisement
-Data which should be broadcast to devices.  Advertisement Data elements must
-follow the API for LE Advertisement Data described above.
-
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.LEAdvertisingManager1
-Object path	/org/bluez/{hci0,hci1,...}
-
-Methods		RegisterAdvertisement(object advertisement, dict options)
-
-			Registers an advertisement object to be sent over the LE
-			Advertising channel.  The service must be exported
-			under interface LEAdvertisement1.
-
-			InvalidArguments error indicates that the object has
-			invalid or conflicting properties.
-
-			InvalidLength error indicates that the data
-			provided generates a data packet which is too long.
-
-			The properties of this object are parsed when it is
-			registered, and any changes are ignored.
-
-			If the same object is registered twice it will result in
-			an AlreadyExists error.
-
-			If the maximum number of advertisement instances is
-			reached it will result in NotPermitted error.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
-					 org.bluez.Error.InvalidLength
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotPermitted
-
-		UnregisterAdvertisement(object advertisement)
-
-			This unregisters an advertisement that has been
-			previously registered.  The object path parameter must
-			match the same value that has been used on registration.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist
-
-Properties	byte ActiveInstances
-
-			Number of active advertising instances.
-
-		byte SupportedInstances
-
-			Number of available advertising instances.
-
-		array{string} SupportedIncludes
-
-			List of supported system includes.
-
-			Possible values: "tx-power"
-					 "appearance"
-					 "local-name"
-					 "rsi"
-
-		array{string} SupportedSecondaryChannels [Experimental]
-
-			List of supported Secondary channels. Secondary
-			channels can be used to advertise with the
-			corresponding PHY.
-
-			Possible values: "1M"
-					 "2M"
-					 "Coded"
-
-		dict SupportedCapabilities [Experimental]
-
-			Enumerates Advertising-related controller capabilities
-			useful to the client.
-
-			Possible Values:
-
-				byte MaxAdvLen
-
-					Max advertising data length
-
-				byte MaxScnRspLen
-
-					Max advertising scan response length
-
-				int16 MinTxPower
-
-					Min advertising tx power (dBm)
-
-				int16 MaxTxPower
-
-					Max advertising tx power (dBm)
-
-		array{string} SupportedFeatures [readonly,optional,Experimental]
-
-			List of supported platform features. If no features
-			are available on the platform, the SupportedFeatures
-			array will be empty.
-
-			Possible values: "CanSetTxPower"
-
