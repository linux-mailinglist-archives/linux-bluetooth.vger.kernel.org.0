thanks for your reminder. will do it for further mail.

for new introduced ioctl, who use it will define semantics and ensure it has
unchanged value as HCIUARTGETPROTO.

for QCA protocol, it specify soc_type and soc_type is defined clearly.

hope i can find some present usage or example from kernel.

for new introduced ioctl, it is not random value. it is soc_type.
hci_qca driver will check its availability.

do you have any better propose for how to specify driver specific settings ?

this solution maybe look ugly. but it actually is the simplest and the lowest
risky fix.

no, as explained in cover letter. tool btattch is very useful,
vendor and customer often need to use it even if it still use ldisc interfaces.

vendor and customer often need to attach vendor's BT module to generic linux
machine, then use tool btattach to enable BT and  complete many tasks. as explained
by
https://lore.kernel.org/all/5bcf5034-fea4-43c6-ac7d-db6f24b88512@quicinc.com/

so i need to add tool btattach support for many other QCA soc types.

>i agree with you. as you known, soc type is embedded in everywhere of
hci_qca driver. since i ever considered auto detection soc_type and it will
involve many of changes and perhaps introduce high ricky broken for present
many qca BT socs. so i drop the solution. let me try to go back auto detection
solution.
thanks
