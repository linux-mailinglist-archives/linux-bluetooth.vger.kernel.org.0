The presentation delay is configured as 40ms, the device also reports
max=min=40ms limits for the delay.

The CIG configuration is

< HCI Command: LE Set Connected.. (0x08|0x0062) plen 33 #686 [hci1]
    CIG ID: 0x00
    Central to Peripheral SDU Interval: 10000 us (0x002710)
    Peripheral to Central SDU Interval: 10000 us (0x002710)
    SCA: 201 - 500 ppm (0x00)
    Packing: Sequential (0x00)
    Framing: Unframed (0x00)
    Central to Peripheral Maximum Latency: 100 ms (0x0064)
    Peripheral to Central Maximum Latency: 100 ms (0x0064)
    Number of CIS: 2
    CIS ID: 0x00
    Central to Peripheral Maximum SDU Size: 120
    Peripheral to Central Maximum SDU Size: 120
    Central to Peripheral PHY: LE 2M (0x02)
    Peripheral to Central PHY: LE 2M (0x02)
    Central to Peripheral Retransmission attempts: 0x05
    Peripheral to Central Retransmission attempts: 0x05
    CIS ID: 0x01
    Central to Peripheral Maximum SDU Size: 120
    Peripheral to Central Maximum SDU Size: 120
    Central to Peripheral PHY: LE 2M (0x02)
    Peripheral to Central PHY: LE 2M (0x02)
    Central to Peripheral Retransmission attempts: 0x05
    Peripheral to Central Retransmission attempts: 0x05

Sometimes the desynchronization appears immediately after connect, or
randomly during playback.  It can also be part of the time be triggered
by walking away from the transmitter, or covering the earpieces by hands
until it starts to stutter. This last one is the most reliable reproducer,
but still not high success rate so a bit hard to debug.

In one case this persisted also over device disconnect + reconnect.

From the ISO socket user side, nothing unusual seems to happen, all
writes succeed so we're not dropping data. In one case I checked where
the playback was desynchronized after start, we were writing to both
sockets every 10ms with max +-0.2ms jitter.

Not sure how to debug this further right now. Maybe should check with
different devices.

I missed that patch, seems to work fine with it.

This might be partly due to bad QoS.

good:

< HCI Command: LE Set Connected.. (0x08|0x0062) plen 33 #686 [hci1]
...
 Central to Peripheral Maximum Latency: 100 ms (0x0064)
 Peripheral to Central Maximum Latency: 100 ms (0x0064)

bad:

< HCI Command: LE Set Connected.. (0x08|0x0062) plen 33 #862 [hci1]
...
 Central to Peripheral Maximum Latency: 20 ms (0x0014)
 Peripheral to Central Maximum Latency: 20 ms (0x0014)

In the "good" case there is sometimes crackling, but in the "bad" case
it's continuous.

However, also in the "good" case it seems we are not receiving all RX
packets we should get. The average RX rate in btmon seems to be 183
packets/s for two devices instead of 200/s. (Suspiciously close to
200*44100/48000...)

The "bad" case occurred because BlueZ does not pass the Latency parameter (or
any other QoS parameters) to SelectProperties if it has not connected to the
device before, so we ended up configuring the QoS with low-latency value from
BAP Table 5.2, which apparently the devices couldn't handle. (I switched this
now to use the "high-reliability" values from the table as fallback, but it's a
workaround.)

IIUC the max latency is supposed to be configured as

1. Target_Latency -> Config Codec -> Max_Transport_Latency
2. select good Max_Transport_Latency -> Config QoS

Currently SelectProperties is supposed to select QoS parameters, but it
is called before Config Codec, so Max_Transport_Latency, preferred
Presentation_Delay, etc. are not known at that time if bluez didn't
cache them somewhere.

I see there are some TODOs in BlueZ sources on this, so looks like known issue.

I'll try to come back to this.

In realtime context it seems what isotest.c does (or intends to --- does
it actually skip the first sleep to have extra packets queued in
controller?) probably is equivalent to pushing num extra packets of
silence to the socket when playback starts.

Looking at Core v5.3, Part G, Fig 3.2, it seems to me this increases
latency by the number of extra packets pushed, on top of the transport
latency. If it is so, I think we'd like to use as few as possible or
none.

OTOH, if the statement is that we should write num=latency/interval packets
every num intervals, I don't quite understand why, and it seems also
this should increase latency because we need to gather all that audio
data before we can send it to the socket?
