Hi Luiz,

I have 25 devices running with bluez 5.54 + the fix that you push. I
have always segmentation fault but not very frequently. I have a demon
which is checking that Bluetoothd is always alive. The check is
running every minute.
Two times, my watchdog was able to detect the Bluetoothd was not
running anymore. In both case it was just after a disconnect. But I
dont know if the disconnect is triggered by
the crash on bluetoothd or if the crash happened just after

I cannot reproduce it in a deterministic way. I cannot deploy valgrind
on all device of course. Is there another way to share with you data
to help you to fix/understand the issue?

Arthur.
