So you want to change that check to check for FEATURE_CATEGORY_2
instead of checking if AVRCP_EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED has been registered?
Note that the reason why this was done like that is because there is
no record to check the version so I assume there are no features to
check either, I wonder how these devices are even qualified like that.
Anyway we probably need more code comments when we are doing something
like that, and perhaps we could have some entry on main.conf, under
AVRCPO, to make these checks less strict so the system can allow
things like 1.3 with FEATURE_CATEGORY_2 and target without record.
