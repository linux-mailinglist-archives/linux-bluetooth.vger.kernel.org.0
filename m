I am fine with the name. Just extend the === to match the text above.

I would actually prefer if we put them into a 2 octet size value. So two times s8 fields. And then just call it "Supported Tx Power (LE)”.

Actually no. If the command is not available or failed, then this field will not be present. Clearly indicate the absence. The should be a clear difference if the command is not available and the controller returning -127.

Can we split this change into a separate patch please.

If we leave the Flags that tell what adv data and scan rsp data to add, then we should also return the leftover sizes of each fields so that the caller knows how much they can occupy. So that you don’t have to use Get Advertising Size Information command to get that information. We already know it at this point in time.

Wouldn’t we just add this to Flags instead of yet another parameter?

This can get tricky with Instance Added and Instance Removed events. We would have to describe on how that is handled.
