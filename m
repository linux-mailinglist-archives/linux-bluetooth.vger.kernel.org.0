Id leave the endpoint the option to return the QoS on
SelectProperties, if it doesn't then we call SelectQoS, that said this
also means we need to wait until the endpoint respond with the QoS in
order to create the socket or we have to create the socket without any
QoS which afaik is required to bind.

Well it is also possible that the server returns non-optiomal
preferences compared to a different codec configuration but we can
only know that once the codec is configured, so we need to be prepared
for the headset to misbehave like many do in case of A2DP, but in case
of BAP they can messed up in both Codec configuration and QoS stages.

In principle Im nore in favor of keeping the logic of bluetoothd
calling into the endpoint object when it is necessary, we also may
apply the same logic as for A2DP that use the last configuration when
reconnecting, so there is no guessing but more of a policy of using
the last configuration to make the reconnections as quick as possible.
If the user wants to change the configuration he can do via
SetConfiguration, but this normally requires a user interaction, also
if the idea would be to have the reconnection policy on top of
bluetoothd Id say it is probably not recommended as that would
probably be slower and it may not know all the endpoints registered in
order to properly infer what is the best configuration to use.
