Subject: [PATCH BlueZ 0/1] Free ALSA seq resources in midi_device_remove()
Date:   Mon,  1 Nov 2021 14:49:17 +0100

I am having problem connecting via Bluetooth LE MID to my VOX Adio Air GT
guitar amplifier. I was not able to debug the connection problem yet,
but there was a bigger problem on hand: due to constant
connecting/disconnecting ALSA seq resources were leaking until
bluetoothd hung and ALSA backend crashed.

I have described a bit more in the github issue: https://github.com/bluez/bluez/issues/225

I was able to fix the leak with the following patch. I am not sure if
that is the right way to do this, though. As the relation between
midi_disconnect() and midi_device_remove() functions is not clear to me,
I have just copied some of the cleanup code from one to the other.
