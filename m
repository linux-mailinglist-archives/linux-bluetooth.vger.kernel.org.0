  adapter: Use regular discovery for filters which only have discoverable set

discovery_filter_to_mgmt_cp() does not add discovery_filter.discoverable
to the created mgmt_cp_start_service_discovery struct.

Instead update_discovery_filter() separately checks
client->discovery_filter->discoverable for all clients.

This means that for discovery-filters which only have the discoverable
flag set, to put the adapter in discoverable mode while discovering,
the created mgmt_cp_start_service_discovery struct is empty.

This empty mgmt_cp_start_service_discovery struct then gets sent
to the kernel as part of a MGMT_OP_START_SERVICE_DISCOVERY msg
by start_discovery_timeout().

This use of an empty filter with MGMT_OP_START_SERVICE_DISCOVERY
causes some bluetooth devices to not get seen with some (most?)
Broadcom bluetooth adapters. This problem has been observed with
the following Broadcom models: BCM4343A0, BCM43430A1, BCM43341B0 .

On these models the following 2 devices were not being discovered
when starting a scan with a filter with just discoverable set
in the filter (as gnome-bluetooth does):

Since setting the discoverable flag on a filter only is a way to
automatically put the adapter in discoverable mode itself while
it is discovering; and since this does not any device filtering
at all; modify merge_discovery_filters() to treat discovery with
such filters as regular unfiltered discovery.

This results in start_discovery_timeout() starting regular
discovery through a MGMT_OP_START_DISCOVERY message and this
fixes these 2 example devices not getting discovered by the
mentioned Broadcom BT adapter models.
