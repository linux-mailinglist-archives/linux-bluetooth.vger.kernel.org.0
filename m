Hmm, I made it queue and wait for the previous Create CIS to fully complete before emitting the next one, and that did seem to also work (also with TWS playback to the Samsung device).
However did not extensively test, so even if allowed by spec risks running to controller issues?

The problem here is that the second CIS is not necessarily going to come, as it may be unrelated device put to same CIG since controller doesn't support multiple CIG.

In principle sound server can acquire always all CIS, but then we should expose also the cig/cis properties on transports so they know which ones are needed.

It could also make sense for BlueZ do it, when any cis in cig is started.
