Sound like a good idea, it means the actual configuration is always
done via SelectProperties, that said we need to make sure this works
with A2DP as well or state that it only applies to BAP, we could
perhaps introduce a property to indicate that the endpoint implements
SelectProperties.

Yeah, the PresentationDelay was moved into QoS property.

That is subject to change though.

Will mark it as unicast only.

Yeah, it seems we never implemented it, but I consider it a gap not a
inconsistency with the code.

Is it? Or perhaps I had changed it later on when splitting the
documentation on a per-interface, at least on
org.bluez.MediaEndpoint.rst there is no entry were PHY is a string, or
you are talking about the actual code here?

The way Im designing these properties are that MediaEndpoint actually
carries the preferences and MediaTransport the configuration as far as
BAP is concerned, perhaps I shall actually state it though.

Input shall be considered the remote preferences and the output the
local configuration.

I will attempt to clarify that.
