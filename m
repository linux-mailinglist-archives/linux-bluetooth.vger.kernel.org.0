moved. But when we upgrade the build from 100 to 101, the app gets the wron=
g data. We looked at the log. When the app tries to read temperature by usi=
ng the temperature UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received =
the request to read the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device nam=
e" is returned to the app as the temperature. This looks like the same beha=
vior as the bluetooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/blue=
tooth/[BT_MAC]/cache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the fil=
es in the folder. That means the disabled cache seems working.
