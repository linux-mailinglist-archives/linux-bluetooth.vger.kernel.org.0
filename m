6.4? From the fixes tag it sounded like it was 6.1. Whatever, doesn't
make a difference, because:

That answer doesn't answer the question afaics, as both 6.1 and 6.4 were
released in the past year -- the fix thus should not wait till the next
merge window, unless it's high risk or something. See this statement
from Linus:

That would be great, too!
