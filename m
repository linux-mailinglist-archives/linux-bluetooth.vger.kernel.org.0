Ahh, I see, you have two different trees, and not different branches in
one tree. Sorry, should have noticed that.

I'm no expert here, but subsystems use different strategies afaics. Most
afaics have two branches in one tree or (like you) two trees. Both are
in next. And they only merge the -fixes branch into their -next tree
when there is a need, not regularly (that iirc would upset Linus).

Can't that be changed? Also: that sounds (but I might be wrong there!)
like -fixes you send to Linus don't get tested independently. Wouldn't
that be better?

Stephen might be the better one to answer that, but from his mails and
my understanding of it it's more like "if duplicates happen occasionally
(for example because some change queued for -next turns out needs to be
send through -fixes quickly), it's not a problem. But it shouldn't be
something that happens due to the regular workflow.

I've also seen a few people including Greg complain about Fixes: tags
for commits that don't exist -- which is the case until the duplicate
commit (like the 81b3e33bb054 that triggered this discussion) lands
during the next merge window. But during that time window it can easily
confuse people I guess.

Anyway, maybe I shouldn't have send anything, this is not my area of
expertise. It's just that I noticed the mails from Stephen, the
complains from Greg, and that one discussion at maintainers summit or
LPC where "more trees should have their -fixes branch in next" very
briefly came up.

Ciao, Thorsten
