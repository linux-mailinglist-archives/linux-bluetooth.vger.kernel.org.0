there are no v3 patch for patch serial with this tile
the updated patch serial tile is "Fix two regression issues for QCA
controllers" shown by above mentioned link.

let us discuss it with the updated one.

v3 of the updated one has good commit message for this issue. you have
given reply with the v3 and it seems you understand what is the problem

now. you understood why your merged change as shown link of 4) have
