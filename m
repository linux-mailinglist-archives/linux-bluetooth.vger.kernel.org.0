Hello Marcel, thank you very much for the feedback! Some responses below:

> I would rather return the value right away and only allow it when powered=
 on.

I have already imposed a "powered" requirement for both MGMT
advertising commands and in the documentation here. In our discussions
regarding this feature, we had chosen to emit a Tx Power Selected
event because these "extended" advertising commands may be used even
on platforms without controller support for extended advertising
features. In other words, we thought it would make more sense to emit
a Tx Power Selected event when relevant, rather than always returning
a Tx power in the MGMT response, even if it is not relevant. If you
think I should return the selected Tx Power directly, I can do so.
Perhaps we can populate the response with
HCI_ADV_TX_POWER_NO_PREFERENCE if extended advertising is not
available. Please let me know your thoughts.

> I was thinking we rename Read Security Information Command and also retur=
n these values there. I think it is a bit of waste to introduce yet another=
 command to return controller capabilities.

My mistake, I was under the impression that you preferred adding a new
command. I will look into adding the new Tx power range parameters to
the "Read Security Information Command". Please let me know your
preferred new name for the command.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Best,
Daniel Winkler
