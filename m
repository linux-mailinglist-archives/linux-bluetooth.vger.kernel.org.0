The intent if the architecture was to allow for finer control with future controllers, and thus a mesh-io.c which doesn’t assume anything about underlying controllers, and then an *initial* mesh-io-generic.c which is what gets used by 4.x controllers... as more controllers are supported with finer tuning available, then mesh-io-<bt5+>.c can be added to the abstracted list.
