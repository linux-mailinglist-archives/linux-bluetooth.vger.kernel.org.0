I have tried with my own fake CSR Bluetooth 5.0 adapter on Windows 10 and that
works fine after i manually override the default plug and play driver with the
generic bluetooth dongle driver in Device Manager. I could connect and use BLE
devices without issues but on Linux it can see other devices but not connect
regardless of bluetooth version.

Details on the dongle from Linux Kernel 5.8.3
