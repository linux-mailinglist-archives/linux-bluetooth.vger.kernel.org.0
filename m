Hi Luiz,

Thank you so much! You're absolutely right.

I'll talk to our team to upgrade our Ubuntu to 20.04 LTS. Then I'll
test the BlueZ 5.53 which is the latest version on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Thanks again!
Kenny

d. But when we upgrade the build from 100 to 101, the app gets the wrong da=

he temperature UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received the =
request to read the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device name" i=
s returned to the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavior=
 as the bluetooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/bluetoot=
h/[BT_MAC]/cache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files i=
n the folder. That means the disabled cache seems working.
