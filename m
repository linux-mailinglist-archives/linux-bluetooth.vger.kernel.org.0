I am Mr.Richard, i work as an accountant in a bank. I am contacting
you independently of my investigation in my bank, i discovered an
abandoned sum of $11.6million dollars, the money belongs to one of our
foreign customer who died along with his supposed next of kin since
July 22, 2003. The money has been here in our Bank lying dormant for
19years now without anybody coming for the claim of it. I need your
urgent assistance in transferring the fund into your private bank
account.

I want the bank to release the money to you as the nearest relative
and next of kin to our deceased customer. The banking laws here does
not allow such money to stay more than 21years because the money will
be recalled to the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. That is
why contacted you for a business deal where this money can be shared
between us in the ratio of 40% for you and 60% for me by indicating
your interest i will send you the full details on how the business
will be executed.
