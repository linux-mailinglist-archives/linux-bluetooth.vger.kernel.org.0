The profile itself has no interest in how the platform is built. What you are going to do is configure possible PCM data path options and then the kernel will use that information for Enhanced Sync Setup. However the profile should only provide the over-the-air settings since that is what is going to be negotiated during the profile setup.

Only because HCI has a single command for things, doesn’t mean we are stuffing all of the information via a single ioctl and then let userspace deal with the mess. That is not how we designed things.

the interface to the kernel needs to minimal. Tell it what you want and it tells you back what you got. Exposing a HCI command structure via ioctl is not the solution.
