Hello,

i am trying to implement a communication channel that uses BLE Security 
Mode 2 Lvl 1 or 2. Both participants that need to communicate are 
Raspberry Pi's running Raspberry Pi OS and BlueZ as Bluetooth Stack. The 
data i want to send is already encrypted which makes Data Signing 
interesting for me.

Does BlueZ Support BLE Security Mode 2 Lvl 1/2 and if yes how can i 
access the functionality?

Furthermore in my research to find the answer for this question i always 
seemed to come across Security Mode 3 mentioned in combination with 
BlueZ. Does this simply refer to Security Mode 1 Lvl 3?

In order to find an answer for this question: I searched the web 
rigorously / Tried to find an answer in forums / Read the Documentation 
/ Tried to read the source code / Checked the archives

As i found nearly nothing regarding this topic my last resort is to ask 
this E-Mail Chain and i would be extremely gratefull if someone would be 
able to answer my question or tip me off into the right direction.

Thank you very much for your time and help in advance!

Best regards,
Christian Seifert
