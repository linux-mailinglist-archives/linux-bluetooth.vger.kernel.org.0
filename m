Luiz, this is not truth. What is not supported are also custom
parameters and custom codecs; including hardware mSBC support.

Last year I started this thread because kernel blocks usage of
AuriStream codec in any form (software or hardware).

And AuriStream is supported by many bluetooth headsets and should have
better quality than CVSD codec.

Apparently all people who are periodically writing me private emails are
not interested in car industry, but are ordinary desktop / laptop users
and ofono is not ready for these use cases and are not going to fix it.
I guess that Aleksander and Andrew too are desktop / laptop users and
not from car industry.
