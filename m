I sent an example patch to the list that adds an option to launch PW
with tools/test-runner so that you get the endpoints registered. You
have to disable a few things for it to run in plain environment (ALSA
device reservations and flatpak portal want DBus user session, logind
integration wants logind).

The "session manager" is some JACK terminology, not really related to
user sessions, in PW it is what coordinates audio device discovery, and
connects clients to devices, so you have to run one.
