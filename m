Hello Luiz,

Thanks for your review.

I didn't know about "l2cap-tester.c". Agree, it would be great to
integrate my test app into it. I could try, but I don't know the test
framework yet.

This commit intended to increase the visibility during debugging, and
I was not intending it for a permanent presence in the kernel.
But if you find it useful, I can submit a patch RFC v2 with
"bt_dev_dbg()" instead of "BT_DBG()". Note that there is currently no
"bt_dev_dbg()" in "l2cap_core.c" yet.

I fully agree with your analysis, which correspond to mine: we should
call "l2cap_conn_del()", it would properly clean the allocations in
"l2cap_conn_add()".
I have tried but it was not obvious to find the right place to call
"l2cap_conn_del()" with the proper locking.
As you write, connect_cfm/disconnect_cfm is not called when the
connection is aborted, and that is the root cause of the memory leak.

Your proposal is most probably the best way to go.

Interesting, could you explain how you would do it? Perhaps point on
a callback example?
