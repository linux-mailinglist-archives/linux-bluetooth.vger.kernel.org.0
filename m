I think you misunderstood my point about HOG hijacking. Consider the
following case:
1. A legit application (not System UI) on a host computer scans and
connects to a nearby peer. It makes a guess about the peer device
based on its advertising data. It intends to operate on a specific
GATT profile (not necessarily Battery).
2. The peer device turns out to be malicious. It runs HOG GATT server
and triggers the host's HOG profile to be active.
3. The malicious peer device's HOG GATT server can now maliciously
make mouse movements or enter keystrokes to the host.

In this case the user is considered being attacked, because he/she
doesn't consciously interact with the System UI to connect to a nearby
mouse/keyboard.
My example doesn't have to be HOG. It just happens to be a profile
which is attackable at the moment. My point is that, for applications
it's always safest to turn off all internal profiles to avoid such
incident. There is no use case where applications want to trigger
internal profiles.

Note 1: By "applications", I mean things like Android apps or
JavaScript apps which are not considered System's Bluetooth UI.
