You want the docs changes to be a separate patch? I can do that, but I
thought that having documentation changes be added along with the
property itself would have been desirable.

The rfkill calls made by GNOME are usually sent to all the rfkill
devices, rather than targeted at blocking a single adapter. So the
adapter state isn't super interesting in this case, as all the devices
will be either blocked (computer with no platform rfkill), or gone from
the USB bus (computer with a platform rfkill).


The good thing about using a string property here is that we can extend
it. One thing we can do though, to make extensibility easier, is take a
leaf out of the icon naming specification, and use prefixes to encode
the expected state in case the software isn't new enough to know about
a property.

For example:
- "on"
- "off"
- "on-disabling" (transitioning from on to off)
- "off-enabling" (transitioning from off to on)

So we could easily add:
- "off-rfkill" (off and blocked)

Let me know what you think.

Cheers
