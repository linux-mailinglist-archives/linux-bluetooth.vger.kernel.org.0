why do we always end up in these rock vs hard-place situations ;)

You might realize that I am really reluctant with whitelisting of behavior that should be default. Do you happen to have a bit more data that you can share?

Or can we do at least something like QUIRK_VALID_LE_STATES and if that quirk is not set, then only central mode gets enabled. We can then provide a debugfs setting for that quirk.

Marcel
