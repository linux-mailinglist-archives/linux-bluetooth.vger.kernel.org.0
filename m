+Methods

+void Answer()
+`````````````
+
+Answers an incoming call. Only valid if the state of the call is "incoming".
+
+Possible Errors:
+:org.bluez.Error.InvalidState
+:org.bluez.Error.Failed
+
+void Hangup()
+`````````````
+
+Hangs up the call.
+
+For an incoming call, the call is hung up using ATH or equivalent. For a
+waiting call, the remote party is notified by using the User Determined User
+Busy (UDUB) condition. This is generally implemented using CHLD=0.
+
+Please note that the GSM specification does not allow the release of a held
+call when a waiting call exists. This is because 27.007 allows CHLD=1X to
+operate only on active calls. Hence a held call cannot be hung up without
+affecting the state of the incoming call (e.g. using other CHLD alternatives).
+Most manufacturers provide vendor extensions that do allow the state of the
+held call to be modified using CHLD=1X or equivalent. It should be noted that
+Bluetooth HFP specifies the classic 27.007 behavior and does not allow CHLD=1X
+to modify the state of held calls.
+
+Based on the discussion above, it should also be noted that releasing a
+particular party of a held multiparty call might not be possible on some
+implementations. It is recommended for the applications to structure their UI
+accordingly.
+
+NOTE: Releasing active calls does not produce side-effects. That is the state
+of held or waiting calls is not affected. As an exception, in the case where a
+single active call and a waiting call are present, releasing the active call
+will result in the waiting call transitioning to the 'incoming' state.

+
+Properties
+----------
+
+string LineIdentification [readonly]
+````````````````````````````````````
+
+Contains the Line Identification information returned by the network, if
+present. For incoming calls this is effectively the CLIP. For outgoing calls
+this attribute will hold the dialed number, or the COLP if received by the
+audio gateway.
+
+Please note that COLP may be different from the dialed number. A special
+"withheld" value means the remote party refused to provide caller ID and the
+"override category" option was not provisioned for the current subscriber.
+
+string IncomingLine [readonly, optional]
+````````````````````````````````````````
+
+Contains the Called Line Identification information returned by the network.
+This is only available for incoming calls and indicates the local subscriber
+number which was dialed by the remote party. This is useful for subscribers
+which have a multiple line service with their network provider and would like
+to know what line the call is coming in on.
+
+string Name [readonly]
+``````````````````````
+
+Contains the Name Identification information returned by the network, if
+present.
+
+boolean Multiparty [readonly]
+`````````````````````````````
+
+Contains the indication if the call is part of a multiparty call or not.
+
+Notifications if a call becomes part or leaves a multiparty call are sent.
+
+string State [readonly]
+```````````````````````
+
+Contains the state of the current call.
+
+Possible values:

+``````````````````````````
+
+Call number, if number is void try to call last dialed number.
+Initiates a new outgoing call. Returns the object path to the newly created
+call.
+
+The number must be a string containing the following characters:
+`[0-9+*#,ABCD]{1,80}` The character set can contain numbers, `+`, `*`, `#`,
+`,` and the letters `A` to `D`. Besides this sanity checking no further number
+validation is performed. It is assumed that the gateway and/or the network
+will perform further validation.
+
+If number is an empty string, it will try to call last dialed number.
+
+NOTE: If an active call (single or multiparty) exists, then it is
+automatically put on hold if the dial procedure is successful.
+

+:org.bluez.Error.NotSupported:

+
+void SwapCalls()
+````````````````
+
+Swaps Active and Held calls. The effect of this is that all calls (0 or more
+including calls in a multi-party conversation) that were Active are now Held,
+and all calls (0 or more) that were Held are now Active.
+
+GSM specification does not allow calls to be swapped in the case where Held,
+Active and Waiting calls exist. Some modems implement this anyway, thus it is
+manufacturer specific whether this method will succeed in the case of Held,
+Active and Waiting calls.
+
+Possible Errors:

+
+void ReleaseAndAnswer()
+```````````````````````
+
+Releases currently active call (0 or more) and answers the currently waiting
+call. Please note that if the current call is a multiparty call, then all
+parties in the multi-party call will be released.
+
+Possible Errors:
+:org.bluez.Error.InvalidState
+:org.bluez.Error.Failed
+
+void ReleaseAndSwap()
+`````````````````````
+
+Releases currently active call (0 or more) and activates any currently held
+calls. Please note that if the current call is a multiparty call, then all
+parties in the multi-party call will be released.
+
+Possible Errors:
+:org.bluez.Error.InvalidState
+:org.bluez.Error.Failed
+
+void HoldAndAnswer()
+````````````````````
+
+Puts the current call (including multi-party calls) on hold and answers the
+currently waiting call. Calling this function when a user already has a both
+Active and Held calls is invalid, since in GSM a user can have only a single
+Held call at a time.
+
+Possible Errors:
+:org.bluez.Error.InvalidState
+:org.bluez.Error.Failed
+
+void HangupAll()

+
+array{object} CreateMultiparty()
+````````````````````````````````
+
+Joins active and held calls together into a multi-party call. If one of the
+calls is already a multi-party call, then the other call is added to the
+multiparty conversation. Returns the new list of calls participating in the
+multiparty call.
+
+There can only be one subscriber controlled multi-party call according to the
+GSM specification.
+
+Possible Errors:

+void SendTones(string tones)
+````````````````````````````
+
+Sends the DTMF tones to the network. The tones have a fixed duration.

+are typically not used in normal circumstances.
