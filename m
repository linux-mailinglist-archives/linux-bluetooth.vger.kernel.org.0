so bluetoothd is doing a service discovery via BR/EDR and then terminated the L2CAP link used for SDP. However then the remote device / phone terminates the BR/EDR link. They LE link seems not be terminated.

Nothing looks bad here. It is a bit of extra traffic, but bluetoothd actually has to learn about the BR/EDR services somehow.

Marcel
