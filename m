My understanding here is that only one monitor (this is in fact a
filter - which we have been using from the very beginning, and Marcel
suggested to rename it to monitor) can be registered via
RegisterMonitor at a time, and there can be multiple filtering
conditions (such as UUID and other AD data type) within a monitor
depending on the type of the monitor.
My concern with providing filtering conditions as a dictionary is that
it cannot be extended to adopt logical relation among filter
conditions later. For simplicity, we probably don't want to allow an
application to update filter and expect the changes would be reflected
right away (once HCI vendor extensions are in place, this can be
expensive), so we honor whatever filtering conditions read from the
monitor upon RegisterMonitor().

I'd rather have this interface work the same as the Advertising API,
since we need to report failures upon registering an ADV monitor, e.g.
there may be no resources to allocate HW filtering or maybe the
filtering conditions cannot be fulfilled.

There are basically two ways how we can register an ADV monitor.
(1) RegisterMonitor(object monitor)
The monitor object would have properties that represent the type of
filter, the filtering conditions, RSSI thresholds and their timers.
It's more flexible to have properties representing criteria for filtering.
(2) RegisterMonitor(object monitor, dict thresholds, dict filter)
The monitor object would not have any property at all. This enforces
the no-reuse policy on an ADV monitor by not providing any property to
update. However, this does not fulfill the future use cases where the
filtering can be more complex.
Other the topic on what parameters we should send along with
DeviceFound(), this is the other blocker for settling the API.
Approach (1) seems to be the right way to go, what do you think?

Thanks,
Miao
