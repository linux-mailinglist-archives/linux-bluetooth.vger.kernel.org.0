Actually the decision should be based on the presence of
RegisterApplication method, if that exists then endpoint switching
should be supported as well, so has nothing to do the
GetManagedObjects API of the bluetoothd. That said RegisterApplication
was not made experimental which kind makes 5.51 broken because it
would appear that it endpoint objects would be exposed but when in
fact there are not, anyway lets finally have the code to use this
interface and then we can remove the experimental flag from
MediaEndpoint.
