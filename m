Hi Marcel, I am happy to add the remaining space available for
advertising and scan response data to the response here. However,
userspace already has a local function,
advertising.c:calc_max_adv_len(), that computes the losses caused by
these flags. I imagine that this feature will be useful for any other
application not using userspace bluez so I will add it to the
response, but at the moment userspace does not need it. Please let me
know if you have any further thoughts on this point.

Thanks,
Daniel
