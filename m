For the record I do intend to enable listing available endpoints in
bluetooth-player, which might actually get merged into bluetoothctl as
a new menu, recently there have been some vulnerabilities reported
against these kind of tools that are meant to only be used for testing
purposes so I would only be in favor of installing them with we add
some new build option i.e. --enable-testing and document that these
tools are meant for testing only (and shall probably be package
separately) so we avoid these pointless reports for tools that are not
really meant to be used in production.
