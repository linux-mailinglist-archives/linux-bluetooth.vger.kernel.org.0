>>> this is the wrong fix. It will break in the tarballs. ELL will not install ell/useful.h ever. So every tarball needs to ensure that ell/useful.h is included. Which means you need to follow the fix from iwd here.

for the build case --enable-external-ell you need need ell/useful.h linked or provided in the tarball. All other headers are not needed in that case. See my iwd commit that does exactly that.
