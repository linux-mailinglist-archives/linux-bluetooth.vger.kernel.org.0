Could we possibly implement a configuration that allows for the enabling 
or disabling of key derivation? Currently, a significant portion of 
devices only require either BR/EDR or BLE functionality independently 
and do not need key derivation, which can cause some confusion and 
issues for users. Additionally, as I understand, there are some 
proprietary RTOS Bluetooth protocol stacks that have disabled key 
derivation and support separate management of pairing keys for BR/EDR 
and BLE devices. For example, an IoT device that supports both BR/EDR 
and BLE could be detected as two separate devices by an iPhone, sharing 
the same address—one for BLE used for ANCS notifications (Apple 
Notification Center Service (ANCS) Specification) and the other for 
A2DP. The phone could connect to or remove either device without 
interference between the two.
