Hi Luiz,

For 0001-adapter-Do-not-remove-client-watch-directly-if-disco.patch,
it looks good to me.
For 0002-adapter-Consolitate-code-for-discovery-reply.patch, please
see me following comments.

+static void discovery_reply(struct watch_client *client, uint8_t status)
+{
+       DBusMessage *reply;
+
+       if (!client->msg)
+               return;
+
+       if (!status) {
It'd better to change this to "if (status == MGMT_STATUS_SUCCESS) {".
+               g_dbus_send_reply(dbus_conn, client->msg, DBUS_TYPE_INVALID);
+       } else  {
+               reply = btd_error_busy(client->msg);
+               g_dbus_send_message(dbus_conn, reply);
+       }
+
+       dbus_message_unref(client->msg);
+       client->msg = NULL;
+}
I also notice that we treated the status other than
MGMT_STATUS_SUCCESS to be busy, but this can be addressed as a
separate patch.

For 0003-adapter-Fix-possible-crash-when-stopping-discovery.patch, I
had few comments here.
(1) I didn't see the corresponding changes to pass the pointer of the
adapter as the user data when sending MGMT_OP_STOP_DISCOVERY command.
Should it be part of the patch?
(2) This does resolve the crashing due to use-after-free of a
watch_client. However, the following logic doesn't seem to be correct
to me. If you recall the call path that we discussed, which is
"client1 start_discovery() -> client1 start_discovery_complete() ->
client1 stop_discovery() -> client2 start_discovery() -> client1
detach from D-Bus which triggers discovery_disconnect() -> client1
stop_discovery_complete() -> crash)",
when client2 starts the discovery, client2 is added to
adapter->discovery_list, so once stop_discovery_complete() is called
with client1, client2 is the only client in adapter->discovery_list.
And this statement remains true even with this patch. That being said,
the following "client = adapter->discovery_list->data" would return
client2, which is not supposed to be replied by
stop_discovery_complete() issued by client1. Agree?

+       if (!adapter->discovery_list)
+               return;
+
+       client = adapter->discovery_list->data;

Thanks,
Miao
