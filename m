For me it is also important that we have consistency throughout the API as much as possible. As mentioned, this is the same as SSP, SC, BR/EDR, LE etc. setting that configure core features of the hardware. The mgmt is meant to signal that some feature is supported and then allow enabling it if bluetoothd chooses to do so. That bluetoothd might enable it all the time is by design.

I am not a big fan of just mapping HCI commands to mgmt. If we keep doing that then this is going to explode really quickly. And then we just duplicated HCI.

If we do this with a more general setting like Wideband speech, then we can enable whatever is needed for this specific hardware to get Wideband speech working. I am almost certain there will be some controllers at some point, that need an extra setting or quirk to make this all work. This ensures that it will work for more than just Intel controllers.
