It is probably using the privacy (aka Resolvable Private Address/RPA),
there were quite a few fixes since 5.55 so you might want to update
your version to the latest to see if pairing works properly, note that
the D-Bus object might use the RPA address when it is first paired but
after that if you restart the daemon it will use the Identity Address,
so the any code using the device objects shall not attempt to store
and access the object based on their addresses since that can change
due to these conditions.
