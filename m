I’m not sure I agree with you on the need to expose and adjust  DBus message timeouts, however, I think you are probably correct that the correct place to have that conversation is on the ELL reflector, which can be accessed here:

https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/ell

I still feel though, that you are trying to solve a pre-deployment “debugging” issue by requiring DBus responses for messages that don’t require them.
