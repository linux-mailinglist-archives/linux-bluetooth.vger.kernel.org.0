Great, I saw the patchset but didn't yet have time to take a proper look.

Yes, there'd be two daemons to start in the VM, pipewire and wireplumber,
and running with default config should then result to the endpoints being
created.

The interaction is probably simplest via the command-line tools.
In principle something more clever and better controlled is possible,
but I'd need to think a bit more what's best here.

Output from `pw-dump -m` can be polled and parsed for determining
when daemons are ready, what bluetooth sinks/devices appeared after
connect, etc. `pw-cat` can be used for playback and recording.

Some tests probably can be written along these lines, but without
trying now I don't know yet how well the above would work.

A separate question is how the virtual BT device that is going to
interact with the endpoints is going to be implemented. Hand-coded
data sent via emulator bthost?
