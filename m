We are in the process of coding the Management1 D-Bus interface which includes many of the method calls required for Provisioner support.  The test-mesh python script does *not* work with the meshctl tool, which uses a GATT based architecture.

The D-Bus interface (as described in the doc/mesh-api.txt) works with the bluetooth-meshd daemon which is currently being built out, and it is entirely built on Advertisement (non-GATT) based communication with other nodes.

The methods required for the Provisioner side are not quite ready to be pushed out.
