I am not sure there is no retransmission with current implementation.
AFAIU, ERTM and automatic flush timeout are not linked. ERTM operates at 
L2CAP level while automatic flush timeout [1] operates at ACL level.
When I read the automatic flush timeout set for an A2DP SBC connection 
it returns 0, which means that the connection uses an infinite timeout. 
So, even if higher levels set packets as flushable, the ACL policy 
requests baseband to indefinitely try to send data [3]:
   "The default Flush Timeout shall be infinite,
     i.e. re-transmissions are carried out until
     physical link loss occurs. This is also
     referred to as a 'reliable channel.'"
