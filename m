OK, I guess that means that this is a separate daemon running as a
different user, not, say, PulseAudio running in the user's session
feeding information. Is that right?

Either way, I guess we'll need to test this out once the feature is
merged.

Apart from the concern about having to duplicate the exported
properties, the rest looks good. I've made some additional comments
about the architecture in the design document you shared, but those
should not have any impact on the implementation.

Good job :)
