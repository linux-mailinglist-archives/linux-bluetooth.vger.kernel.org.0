and for that you better use Start Discovery etc. commands.

Otherwise we need a separate command. Starting an active scan is similar to creating a connection. You fundamentally go into a different mode that causes active radio activity. It needs to have a defined lifespan since it will cancel out all passive scanning that is going on otherwise.

Yep. You can not control channels.

And I am saying we should allow sending while _not_ receiving. For debugging purposes or testing or just hacking this will be useful.

Cancel command is a good idea.

Pretty much any BDADDR_ANY should force to generate a NRPA.
