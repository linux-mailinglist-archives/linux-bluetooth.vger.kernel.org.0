Weird, yes. Sending absolute volume command capability is declared in
the AVRCP ICS 2/50, but it can only be selected if 2/8 is also
selected, which is sending passthrough command for category 2.
Therefore, we also need to be able to send a category 2 passthrough.

The test itself is AVRCP/CT/PTT/BV-02-I. This is the test to see
whether we can send a category 2 passthrough, not the one to see
whether we can send the absolute volume command. The test asks us to
send every category 2 passthrough we declared in the ICS file (table
4). There should be at least one passthrough declared.

Then I shall try to have this implemented.
Btw I only took a quick glance, but I did not find the 2 seconds
limitation in the spec.
