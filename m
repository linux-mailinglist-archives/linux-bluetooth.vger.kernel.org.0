That's odd, though searching for it shows this is a common problem
across Xiaomi products.  You might want to manually check getprop
persist.bluetooth.disableabsvol and make sure the phone is rebooted
after enabling absolute volume.  Otherwise look around in the Android
logs, they are pretty verbose about absolute volume support.

Finally, the misunderstanding on my side has been cleared up in
chapter 8.  After reading chapter 2.2.1 I blindly assumed the CT and
TG designation were solely indicating message initiator, while
expecting the Remote Control and Remote Target to be analogous to sink
and source respectively.  That turns out to not be true at all, CT
role =3D=3D Remote Control service, TG =3D=3D Remote Target service.

I honestly wasn't expecting this.  It made too much sense that the
target is where the media player lives, while the controller is where
the "remote controls" are (and usually the rendering device).  That
way headphones would for example not need to expose the "Remote
Control Target" profile, but this finally explains why my headphones
expose that service.

In other words, in order to have any sort of meaningful communication
between two devices (SetAbsoluteVolume from source to sink, and media
controls from sink to source) both peers should handle both services.

This unfortunately means I need to rewrite the patch again and rectify
all earlier conversations in the patch discussion going on
concurrently.

The patch was intended to end up in this mail thread but ended up as a
separate message despite setting in-reply-to correctly.  Am I not
allowed to send in-reply-to on my own message, with the to: field not
matching the original sender of that mail?  Or is it because the
subject does not match this mail thread?  Apologies either way, this
is one of my first dealings with mailing lists :)
