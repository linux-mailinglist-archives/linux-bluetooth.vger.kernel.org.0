OK, it's been a while, but the problem was eventually tracked not to 
BlueZ but a Qt component I was using.  Essentially, changes in BlueZ 
were being tracked by changes in Qt, but there was a problem with the Qt 
implementation starting with BlueZ version 5.55.  No change required in 
BlueZ, and already fixed in Qt, but I thought I'd circle back around and 
let you all know the resolution.
