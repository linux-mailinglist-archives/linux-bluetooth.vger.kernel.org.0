Quick update:

The above was enough to replicate the bug - thanks!
I'm working on a fix, but am unlikely to have a patch before next week.

Long update:

Changing `g_dbus_setup_private()` to `g_dbus_setup()` in pbap.c seems to
fix this problem (but introduces other problems).  I think obexctl is
sending a request that gets received by the normal DBus connection,
which no longer routes the message through to PBAP.  But I'm not yet
confident enough with the codebase to be sure that's what's happening.

If I'm right, the solution is probably to either revisit the idea of
(un)registering things in the normal connection, or to listen for
messages on PBAP's private connection.  But I'm not yet confident enough
with DBus to properly assess either solution.

Neither of the above should take a *huge* amount of time, but will need
a larger block of focussed attention than I'm likely to have this week.
I might get lucky and have a patch by mid-week, but the safer assumption
is that it'll be top of next week's todo list.
