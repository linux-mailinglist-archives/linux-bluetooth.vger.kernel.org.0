Yes, I didn't understand what you meant...

My question is: what piece of code I need to write or modify to have the
"connect" operation working?

As I don't see it once it is paired, I guess it is not using one of
these profiles.

I've written the CUPS driver that works fine with the rfcomm device.
In fact, it's not proprietary, it's ESC/POS protocol.

https://github.com/vivier/phomemo-tools

I'm working on my code to use python-escpos rather than my hack and I'd
like to integrate smoothly the printer in the bluetooth stack.

It works also with USB, but it's a shame not to use bluetooth with a
printer that has an internal battery.


Thanks,
Laurent
