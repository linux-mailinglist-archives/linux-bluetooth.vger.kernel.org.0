BTUSB_WIDEBAND_SPEECH flag is just for usb bluetooth adapters. Not for
UART or SDIO bluetooth adapters.

It is a hint set for some bluetooth adapters which are on kernel
whitelist that wideband speech support is possible for them.

mSBC is not the only one codec which has wideband support.

Based on current "whitelist" implementation it does not mean adapters
without this hint are not mSBC capable (e.g. new adapters could not be
on this list) and also there is a theoretical chance that some with this
flag are not capable of mSBC. But this is only theoretical and I think
you can say that BTUSB_WIDEBAND_SPEECH is sufficient for mSBC. But it is
not necessary condition for mSBC (e.g. because of UART or SDIO adapters
or adapters which are not whitelist yet).

I hope to see AuriStream support which is also wideband speech codec but
should work also with some adapters which are not able to provide enough
bandwidth for mSBC.
