Hi Marcel,

I don't think this solves the original problem we were talking about:
the driver should replace the runtime firmware on reload if it doesn't
match what's on disk.

Some background for the mailing list:
- On a ChromeOS laptop, we discovered that the Bluetooth controller
wasn't being fully powered down in some reboots. As a result, a new
firmware wasn't being applied after an update.
- The kernel driver was checking if the bluetooth controller had
loaded some firmware already. If it was in bootloader mode, it would
download new firmware. If it was not, it would skip downloading new
firmware.

The useful part of this mgmt command is to force the driver to reset
to bootloader (Action = 0 in Set Runtime Firmware). However, without
being able to compare the firmware version loaded on the controller,
there's no clear signal for when this should be called. Loading the
firmware through mgmt may be useful for debugging but you could also
just replace the firmware on disk and "reset to bootloader" to achieve
the same effect. I would actually expect unloading and reloading the
module should do that.

Also, moving the firmware loading from the driver to the userspace
seems odd to me. Since the comparison is between the controller
firmware and disk firmware, there's not much extra that the userspace
knows that the kernel does not.

----

Coming back to the original problem of when to reload runtime
firmware, here are the conditions under which we do and don't want a
reload.

Do want a reload:
- Reboot
- Module is unloaded and reloaded

Don't want a reload:
- Transport disconnection (i.e. usb disconnect; some laptops will
power down USB during suspend to save additional power but BT will
stay powered up)
- Power toggle (bluetooth power off -> power on)
- HCI reset

Letting the kernel driver maintain some sort of table of previously
configured devices might be a better option. We can put that table in
the module's static memory space so that it doesn't get cleared on
device disconnects. These should be useful for internally connected
Bluetooth (which may not always power cycle between resets) and for
which you may want to force reloads around reboot or module reload.
Externally connected Bluetooth will power cycle once disconnected
anyway so this is moot for them.

Thanks,
Abhishek
