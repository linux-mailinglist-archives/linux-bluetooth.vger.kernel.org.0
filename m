yes, these needs to be marked as my hardware is broken.

From a specification point of view, the Enhanced Setup Sync Conn is a super set of the Setup Sync Conn (which is a super set of Add SCO). If implementers screwed that up, we clear spell that out.

Maybe we messed up the usage of the Enhanced Setup Sync Conn and that should be of course checked. I hope the hardware manufactures can chime in here. Or provide firmware updates.

Regards

Marcel
