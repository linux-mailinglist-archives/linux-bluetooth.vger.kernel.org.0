It should, even though I don't immediately see how swapping
target/controller_init as per your initial email solves the problem.

I think this is the version used for the AVRCP Remote Target [1]. The
version linked above, the one that is causing problems here is that of
the AVRCP controller.

There have always been problems changing these settings in developer
options - sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. The system has
been overhauled for Android 11 and is now much more consistent though
avrcp still runs through a property. If I remember correctly
restarting bluetooth or re-adding a device (in case of SDP caching) is
the only solution.

Yes, I think that's the change we proposed last time and are proposing
now. Unfortunately relevant functions need to know if the local
(BlueZ) end is operating as target or controller for that particular
operation.

That depends on the way audio is flowing. When the local (BlueZ) end
is the sink (rendering the audio) meaning it takes the role of AVRCP
controller (the situation in the mail from Marek), the remote must be
the AVRCP target and hence its controller version is irrelevant.
Likewise when BlueZ is the audio source (AVRCP target), it should only
care about the remote controller profile and version.
But that is exactly what you described above: BlueZ needs to attain
separation between handling notification registrations (and perhaps
other code) as a controller and target separately.

Looking at commit 4ae6135 that introduced this check it was apparently
causing crashes without. I can only guess that devices were sending
vendor-specific notification requests, assuming implementations are
supposed to filter out anything beyond what their reported version
supports? Either way input validation is still a sane thing to do.

I guess it is sane here to not report capabilities the CT should -
given it's version - not know about. I could not find anything in the
1.6.2 spec mandating this though, perhaps Luiz knows.

Yeah, Android exposes different versions for its AVRCP Remote and
AVRCP Remote Target.
This is slightly confusing though: we discussed earlier that CT and TG
is about the initiator and receiver respectively, with no direct
mapping to AVRCP remote and target as either side can be the initiator
(sender) of a command. Correct?
In this specific case a notification registration will always be
initiated by a CT and fulfilled by the TG, no matter whether it is an
AVRCP remote or target.

Again, in the specific case of this issue it is fine if the CT
(initiator, the Android phone, supposed to behave like the target as
it is the audio source) reports a controller version of 1.3 as we are
only concerned about the target version, which will be the one
registering for EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED notifications from the
sink/controller (BlueZ). Android always reports the AVRCP Remote
Target as 1.4 or higher based on developer settings [1].

P.S.: I hope it is fine to respond to two emails in one, seems like
that will get confusing real quick if depth increases.
