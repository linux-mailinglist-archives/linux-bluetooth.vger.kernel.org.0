Thank you for the patch, and your response. Sorry for the late reply.

Awesome.

Thank you for the detailed response. I do currently not have a Microsoft 
Windows system to test this, but sounds good.

Personally, I would like to hive this information in the commit message, 
but I d not know the policy of the project. If you are up to it, you 
could amend the commit message, and reroll it.

Thank you for your work.


Kind regards,

Paul
