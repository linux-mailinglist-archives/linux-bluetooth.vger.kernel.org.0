Yeah, but it doesn't make any difference if both BREDR and LE address
type is a public identity address, which must be the case since BREDR
can only be a public address, or are you talking about giving a random
static the same address to a public? While possible I would argue that
is a self inflicted pain because the device should attempt to generate
a unique address exactly for the purpose of not allocating addresses
which may belong to another company (OUI):

https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html

And no, as far as MAC address is concerned there is no address type,
this is something that Bluetooth invented and that I very much dislike
since it completely disregards things like OUI exists.

That is fair enough when the devices are from different manufacturers,
what I'm questioning is why someone would deliberately have the same
address with different address types? Btw, are these devices on the
market already?
