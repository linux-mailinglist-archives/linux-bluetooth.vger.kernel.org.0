That helps with one of the problems I ran into (resetting the
transitional state on failure), thanks.

What I'm after is a transitional state when the Bluetooth adapter is
being powered on, as it can take more than "an instant" (aka 200msec)
to turn on, and sometimes much longer.

Users in that transition period can wonder why the adapter is already
on but not usable, or still off. This is even worse if the enablement
doesn't work, as it could show that the device was on/available for a
time before stopping being available, depending on which option the UI
developer took, which is obviously not true.

I updated the patch for the latest git and completed the commit
message, let me know if that helps.
