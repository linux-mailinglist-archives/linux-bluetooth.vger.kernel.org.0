Hi Carey,

> Problem: The Linux bluetooth stack yields complete control over the BLE

> The Linux bluetooth stack provides access to the BLE connection interval
> min and max values through /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/hci0/
> conn_min_interval and /sys/kernel/debug/bluetooth/hci0/conn_max_interval.
> These values are used for initial BLE connections, but the remote device

patch has been applied to bluetooth-next tree.
