For some reason they tend to squat on the very first CSR/
Cambridge Silicon Radio VID/PID instead of paying fees.

This is an extremely common problem; the issue goes as back as 2013
and these devices are only getting more popular, even rebranded by
reputable vendors and sold by retailers everywhere.

So, at this point in time there are hundreds of modern dongles reusing
the ID of what originally was an early Bluetooth 1.1 controller.

Linux is the only place where they don't work due to spotty checks
in our detection code. It only covered a minimum subset.

So what's the big idea? Take advantage of the fact that all CSR
chips report the same internal version as both the LMP sub-version and
HCI revision number. It always matches, couple that with the manufacturer
code, that rarely lies, and we now have a good idea of who is who.

Additionally, by compiling a list of user-reported HCI/lsusb dumps, and
searching around for Windows drivers with similar product ranges
we can find an official superset within their .inf files.

So it turns out that most of what it was thought to be counterfeit
was just a newer chip with different quirks. Internet shows that
this has been a problem on Windows, too.

So, to sum things up; there are actually three classes of controllers
reusing the same 0A12:0001 VID/PID. This has been broken for a while.

Known 'fake' bcdDevices: 0x0100, 0x0134, 0x1915, 0x2520, 0x7558, 0x8891
  IC markings on 0x7558: FR3191AHAL 749H15143 (???)

Changes in v2:
* Find a better way of detecting which type is which; scrap the wonky
  >=Bluetooth 1.2 protocol check and instead do what's described above.
* Move all the quirk logic to btusb_setup_csr(), simplify it a bit.
* Use a switch statement and list all the known broken bcdDevice
  instead of trying to penalize the real CSR devices.
* Add two bt_dev_info() prints because this may be important in the
  future, given the amount of variables we are playing with here.
* Try to keep my comments within a 80-column limit.

I think this makes way more sense, getting all the dongles to work without
penalizing either side. And provides a baseline to *maybe* expand the list
in the future, easily. But I'm pretty sure it should cover most of them.

Let me know what you think.
