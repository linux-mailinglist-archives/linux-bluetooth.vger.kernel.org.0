+
+-------------------------
+Advertise Options Submenu
+-------------------------
+
+:Version: BlueZ
+:Copyright: Free use of this software is granted under ther terms of the GNU
+            Lesser General Public Licenses (LGPL).
+:Date: November 2022
+:Manual section: 1
+:Manual group: Linux System Administration
+
+SYNOPSIS
+========
+bluetoothctl advertise options submenu can be accessed by the command `menu advertise` in bluetoothctl. If the error "Failed to register advertisement: org.bluez.Error.Failed" is received then check /var/log/syslog for the specific error such as "Advertising data too long or couldn't be generated.". Assuming bluetoothd has the -v option set.
+
+Advertise Options Commands
+==========================
+
+Advertising packets are structured data which is broadcast on the LE Advertising
+channels and available for all devices in range.  Because of the limited space
+available in LE Advertising packets (31 bytes), each packet's contents must be
+carefully controlled.
+
+This is a long form description of the commands that includes examples. Values can either be hexadecimal (0x0C)
+decimal (12) or octal if  a leading zero (07). Footnotes are indicated by {x} and can be found at the bottom of the page.
+
+
+uuids
+-----
+Set/Get advertise uuids
+  The assumed format of the uuid is hex. Therefore uuids 0x1234 identical to uuids 1234.
+  The valid uuids are:
+  - 16 bit uuids - ex: uuids 0x1234
+  - 32 bit uuids - ex: uuids 0x12345678
+  - 128 bit uuids - ex: uuids 90f95193-35de-4306-a6e9-699328f15059
+
+    .. note:: 128 bit uuids must be in the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx where x is a hexadecimal digit and the dashes are included.
+
+:Usage: **# uuids [all/uuid1 uuid2 ...]**
+
+service
+-------
+Set/Get advertise service data
+
+:Usage: **# service [uuid] [data=xx xx ...]**
+
+manufacturer
+------------
+Set/Get advertise manufacturer data
+  updating is in real time while advertising. This is currently limited to 25 bytes and will return an error message of "Too much data"
+  if that maximum has been exceeded. However, this does not check if the advertising payload length maximum has been exceeded so you 
+  may receive an error from bluetoothd that it "Failed to register advertisement" which means you need to reduce your manufacturer data length.
+
+:Usage: **# manufacturer [id] [data=xx xx ...]**
+
+data
+----
+Set/Get advertise data
+  This allows you to advertise data with a given type. You cannot use a registered data type value {1} with 
+  this command. For LE the advertising shows up in the primary advertisements
+  Example: Advertises a nonregistered data type of 0x0C with three octets of data (01 0x0F 13)::
+
+    data 0x0C 01 0x0F 13
+
+  If you set only the type of the data without any data (data 0x0c) this will cause a parse error when turning advertise on.
+  You can only send a maximum of 8 bytes of data. data 0x0c 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07
+  You can modify the advertising data while it is advertising 
+  To get the currently set data use the command data without any arguments
+  To delete the currently set data you need to...   (clear does not appear to work)
+
+:Usage: **# data [type] [data=xx xx ...]**
+
+discoverable
+------------
+Set/Get advertise discoverable
+  For LE discoverable on will set the LE General Discoverable Mode flag to true in the primary advertisement if on.
+  This feature can be changed during advertising, but will only trigger LE General Discoverable Mode even if you had previously selected 
+  discoverable-timeout this will be ignored.
+  Entering the command by itself will show the status of the setting
+
+:Usage: **# discoverable [on/off]**
+
+discoverable-timeout
+--------------------
+Set/Get advertise discoverable timeout
+  Using this feature in LE will cause the LE Limited Discoverable Mode flag to be set in the primary advertisement and 
+  The LE General Discoverable Mode flag will not be set. The LE Limited Discoverable Mode flag will automatically turn off after [seconds]
+  discoverable [on] must be set to use this feature
+  Entering the command by itself will show the time value
+
+:Usage: **# discoverable-timeout [seconds]**
+
+tx-power
+--------
+Show/Enable/Disable TX power to be advertised
+  This sets the TX Power Level field in the advertising packet. The value is in dBm and can be between -127 and 127.
+  Entering the command by itself will show the current value
+  When this feature is turned on the LE device will advertise its transmit power in the primary advertisement
+  This feature can be modified while advertising.
+  Entering the command by itself will show the status of the setting
+
+:Usage: **# tx-power [on/off] [power]**
+
+name
+----
+Configure local name to be advertised
+  Local name to be used in the advertising report. If the string is too big to fit into the packet it will be truncated.
+  It will either advertise as a complete local name or if it has to be truncated then a shortened local name
+  advertise.name "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
+  Text: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abc
+  There does not appear to be a way to tell if it is advertising with a complete or shortened local name.
+
+:Usage: **# name [on/off/name]**
+
+appearance
+----------
+Configure custom appearance to be advertised
+
+:Usage: **# appearance [on/off/value]**
+
+duration
+--------
+Set/Get advertise duration
+  The Duration parameter configures the length of an Instance. The value is in seconds.
+  A value of 0 indicates a default value is chosen for the Duration. The default is 2 seconds.
+  If only one advertising Instance has been added, then the Duration value will be ignored.
+  If multiple advertising Instances have been added, then the Duration value will be used to determine the length of time
+  each Instance is advertised for. The Duration value is used to calculate the number of advertising events that will be
+  used to advertise each Instance. The number of advertising events is calculated by dividing the Duration value by the
+  advertising interval. The advertising interval is determined by the advertising parameters that are set for each
+  Instance. The advertising interval is the maximum of the advertising intervals set for each Instance.
+  The Duration value is used to calculate the number of advertising events that will be used to advertise each Instance.
+  The number of advertising events is calculated by dividing the Duration value by the advertising interval. The advertising
+  interval is determined by the advertising parameters that are set for each Instance. The advertising interval is the maximum
+  of the advertising intervals set for each Instance.
+  The Duration value is used to calculate the number of advertising events that will be used to advertise each Instance.
+  The number of advertising events is calculated by dividing the Duration value by the advertising interval. The advertising
+  interval is determined by the advertising parameters that are set for each Instance. The advertising interval is the maximum
+  of the advertising intervals set for each Instance.
+  The Duration value is used to calculate the number of advertising events that will be used to advertise each Instance.

+:Usage: **# duration [seconds]**
+
+timeout
+-------
+  Set/Get advertise timeout
+
+:Usage: **# timeout [seconds]**
+
+secondary
+---------
+  Set/Get advertise secondary channel
+  The Secondary parameter configures the secondary channel used for advertising.
+
+:Usage: **# secondary [1M/2M/Coded]**        
+
+interval
+--------
+Set/Get advertise interval
+  The Interval parameter configures the advertising interval of an Instance. The value is in milliseconds.
+  A value of 0 indicates a default value is chosen for the Interval. The default is 100 milliseconds.
+  The Interval value is used to calculate the number of advertising events that will be used to advertise each Instance.
+  The number of advertising events is calculated by dividing the Duration value by the advertising interval. The advertising
+  interval is determined by the advertising parameters that are set for each Instance. The advertising interval is the maximum
+  of the advertising intervals set for each Instance.
+
+:Usage: **# interval [milliseconds]**
+
+clear
+-----
+Clear advertise config
+  Clear the advertise configuration. This will stop advertising if it is currently advertising.
+  If you want to change the advertise configuration while advertising you must first clear the advertise configuration
+  and then set the new advertise configuration.
