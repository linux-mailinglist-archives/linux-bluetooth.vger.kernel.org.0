This is a preliminary patch to aid our discussions and show a
potential solution to the problem.  If you want to enforce commenting
style there as well I'll clean that up next time.  It wasn't my intent
to get this merged at all anyway.

Agreed, though I don't know if we need the version. Perhaps this comes
in handy in other places.

CT/TG? I've read section 2.2.1 of the 1.6.2 over and over again, this
doesn't make sense.

Indeed, I don't understand this anymore at all.  The A2DP role should
map directly to the AV Remote (0x110e) and AV Remote Target (0x110c).
It is my understanding that these define what _direction_ events could
possibly go in.  For example in 6.13.2 SetAbsoluteVolume we find:

    It is expected that the audio sink will perform as the TG for this command.

Then, in 6.13.3 Notify Volume Change:

    This Register Notification event is used by the CT to detect when
the volume has been changed locally on the TG, or what the actual
volume level is following use of relative volume commands.
    [...]
    It is expected for this command that the audio sink fulfills the TG role.

That matches what I am trying to explain in all these mails.  We
cannot assume in this function that we are always the server or TG; if
we are the audio source, we must be the CT (when Absolute Volume is
concerned).  This is in accordance with the logical expectation that
the sink is in control of the volume.  The target (source) can change
it by sending SetAbsoluteVolume, or ask the controller (sink) to
update it about volume changes by means of registering this event.
Not the other way around (what would happen if the sink starts sending
SetAbsoluteVolume to the source?).

What can we do to clarify the difference between CT/TG,
target/controller (the profiles), source/sink, client/server?
Terminology is going all over the place to the point that I don't know
how to express my understanding of the system (nor specs) anymore.

How do you propose to figure out what "role" we are providing when
this function is called?  As explained above it depends if we are
sink/controller or source/target what events we are expecting to be
registered.

I think you are confusing what these variables represent.  In the
original BlueZ code this value is based on the version of the peer
AVRCP_REMOTE_UUID.  That to me means we are checking whether we are
expecting our peer to register for that particular event, and
rejecting it otherwise.  I simply extended this to do the same for the
remote version of the AVRCP_TARGET_UUID profile as well.
What you are suggesting is implicitly encoded as well: if we cannot
handle an event registration even though the peer could realistically
request it based on its version, it's not in the list.

It does not regress, and was tested with a bluetooth headset to
confirm.  This is indeed rejecting EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED, and for a
good reason as explained above.  If BlueZ is the source, _it_ will
register this notification with the headset, not the other way around.
Note that get_capabilities_resp/register_notification do not check
*_supported_events, and they shouldn't.

However, say we flip the roles around and make BlueZ a sink, playing
back from an Android phone.  Now avrcp_handle_register_notification
takes controller_supported_events and will happily comply when the
source (the Android phone) registers EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED.

To make this even more explicit insert some log lines in
get_capabilities_resp: this clearly shows when connecting headphones
as sink it only supports EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED - when connecting an
Android phone as source it reports a bunch of playback/player related
events but not EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED.

I think we can initialize this list (as well as
target_supported_events) based on what we expect (as explained above),
and AND it as soon as get_capabilities_resp tells us what the remote
can comply with.
