Thanks Luiz, I don't want to sound dense, and I really appreciate you
and Barry's help, but these aren't duplicate packets (unless, again,
I'm misunderstanding the term). Each packet payload is completely
unique. I'll have a look at the other thread for sure, but I'm really
just trying to understand if the missing packets I identified in the
trace should be there (in the DBus/bluetoothctl trace) or if there's a
reason they were excluded. Again, they weren't duplicates and I'm
reasonably sure I had the duplicate data flags set correctly each
time. Also, whatever is going on is not transient, I can duplicate it
with the senor I'm testing every time (both in my app or via
bluetoothctl). More important for sure is to find a work-around
(hopefully the MGMT api Barry pointed me to) but still just curious
why these packets are getting dropped/filtered... Anyway, thanks again
to you both!
