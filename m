Same thing here, just tested with the latest 5.15 that supposedly should
contains the aforementioned fix above:

With the current firmware in linux-firmware, the issue is still the same af=
ter
a reboot. With the latest firmware (just downloaded ibt-0041-0041.ddc and s=
fi,
but if the wireless portion is needed, I can add that too) and that made th=
ings
even weirder and weirder. After a cold boot, the adapter was working as
standard. Rebooted and the device was disabled by default (my machine is
configured to auto enable the bluetooth at boot), but after disabling and
reenabling the radio from my DE, the bluetooth reconnected to my mouse for =
the
first time since I've got this adapter under Linux. After another reboot, t=
he
radio completely disappeared (not even detected from my DE). I don't really
know where the problem resides, but I'm happy that someone is trying to see=
 to
the bottom of this.

Marco.
