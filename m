So which roles are we talking about here?  Your Design document shows 
hsphfpd registering for both HFP AG and HFP HF roles, but maybe this was 
not the intent?

If you're talking about extending oFono APIs when it is acting as the HF 
connecting to the AG, then codec setup APIs, etc are definitely 
something that would be welcome.

If you're talking about AG role, then that is different... In general, 
if the oFono is in an AG role, then there should be nothing to configure 
and there are no APIs for this role.  Things like reporting AG battery 
level to HFP headset are done directly using plugins.  See 
ofono_emulator_set_indicator and how this is done by upower.c for 
example.  I happily take patches for any additional features (codecs, 
etc) you want to support here.

But... oFono upstream has no interest in accepting forwarded AT commands 
from some external daemon if we're in AG role.  We rejected such a 
design years ago and nothing has changed.

AG role is already quite tricky to implement without additional 
complexity introduced by having multiple applications and IPC.  "Its 
your funeral" as the saying goes if you want to go that route.

So your primary goal here is to have the desktop play the role of the 
AG, purely so you can forward the audio from a headset out to whatever 
it is that you want.  And you want oFono (or some other daemon) to 
(optionally) handle the call related AT commands in the HFP AG role.

Such a design will get a NAK from me on the oFono side.  But don't let 
that stop you.  You can simply invoke oFono APIs directly from your 
daemon.  No need for any changes in oFono itself.  As mentioned above, I 
wouldn't recommend it, but... :)

So again, which role?  If we're the HF connecting to the AG, then things 
just work without a modem.  If we're the AG, then yes you need a modem 
to be driven by the AG connection.

Okay, I see now.  Yes, the above is correct.  My comments about not 
needing a modem device hold true only if oFono is in HFP HF role 
connecting to an AG.
