Sorry, the FTBFS was my error - I didn't do the autotools magic properly. More haste, less speed!

So I've now built and tested 5.17-rc5+ (v5.17-rc5-21-g23d04328444a) with bluetoothd built from a fresh clone of the
bluez git tree taken this morning (HEAD is d89af9a). I'm sorry to say that I still get the intermittent failures when
trying to connect my bluetooth devices. By intermittent I mean that if after starting the system from cold, if the first
attempt to connect fails, then subsequent attempts also fail. If, however, the first attempt succeeds, I can disconnect
and connect again as many times as I want. With a 5.16.10 kernel, connecting and disconnecting  works reliably like it
did with vanilla bluez-5.63.
