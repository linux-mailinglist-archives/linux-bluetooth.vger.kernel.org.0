Yes, good catch, thanks.  I suppose that it got lost at some point when 
I was reformatting the paragraphs.

I don't understand this sentence.  Do you mean that it doesn't emit log 
errors when the extra config files cannot be parsed, like in src/main.c:279?

There's a check at the beginning of confd_override_config(), it emits a 
warning (not an error) if it fails to load the file.

Or do you mean the different, finer-grained checks and logging messages 
when parsing keys and values?

(As means of explaining why I did it that way, not as a reason to change 
it -- I'm fine with doing it in other ways)

I was trying different approaches, I think that I started doing what you 
say when looking at src/main.c.

But then I thought better to implement it in a self-contained way, so 
the changes to the existing code were minimal, and it could be reused in 
different places (profile/input/manager.c, etc), without having to 
replicate the walking over the extra files.

Also, with the config merged into a single GKeyFile in-place, it will 
avoid problems like for example if the parsing_*() functions assume that 
there's only one config file, and in each pass (loading each config 
file) setting default values if they don't find in the current file 
being parsed, even if it was set in a previous pass.  All such places 
parsing config would have to be mindful that there could be multiple 
files, each containing partial config, and so the higher-level code has 
to do the job of merging the partial config.  (Not sure if it makes sense?)

And perhaps a minor nuisance, special cases like use of 
getenv("CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY") will have to be taken into account in 
more places.

So, all in all, I thought that for the existing code and future changes, 
it would be simpler if the GKeyFile returned from load_config() (or 
equivalent in other sections of code) contained the base+extended 
configuration all in one GKeyFile, with the extended config injected in 
that same place of the base file, so it would work transparently for the 
rest of the code parsing it.

Yes, the new code assumes that the base config file is correct, and it 
would paper over errors.

For example, if the base file (e.g. main.conf) contains a wrong group 
not known to the existing bluetooth code, and the extra config contain 
keys in that group, it will load the new key values into GKeyFile.  My 
understanding (I didn't check thoroughly) is that the rest of the 
bluetooh code will ignore these, as it will try to parse only groups and 
keys that it knows about -- it's hardcoded.

Also, in the current implementation, it will mask some problems that 
could be present in the config files.  For example if main.conf contains 
"PairableTimeout = garbage" instead of an integer, and 
main.conf.d/10-override-pairabletimeout.conf contains "PairableTimeout = 
garbageagain", and another 
main.conf.d/99-override-pairabletimeout-final.conf "PairableTimeout = 
0", it will not emit errors for neither main.conf nor 
main.conf.d/10-override-pairabletimeout.conf -- it will only see the 
last "PairableTimeout = 0".

So, yes, this is a disadvantage of this approach... it will paper over 
problems instead of pinpointing the problem in the individual files.

After the explanations above, I guess that you still prefer to load and 
parse each file individually, to detect problems in the individual files?
If so, I'll work on it on the next version.


PS: I will be off for some days so please excuse delays in replying.


Cheers.
