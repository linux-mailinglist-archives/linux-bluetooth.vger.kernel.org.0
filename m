Dear Luiz,

I now have another issue with remote control HID integration 
(non-system; direct implementation).

I am using Java with d-bus BlueZ 5.55 on Debian Linux. I have "hid" and 
"input" plugin disabled on bluetooth startup.

I have one remote integrated and working. With this one after boot and 
while application startup I iterate over all paired devices with 
existing HID service (check for existing service UUID) and then iterate 
all Report characteristics and enabling notifying for all of them (if 
supported). Everything is running well with this (legacy) remote. After 
pairing it also auto-connects using my own registered object manager, as 
suggested by you.

Now we received our final custom remote control from our manufacturer 
(other chip) and this approach does not work any more. I have tried a 
lot of things now. Once the remote control is paired (which is also 
somehow still buggy) and I rebooted the system with our application, the 
device is found in the list as paired, BUT I cannot access the HID 
service any more. Therefore, I cannot enable notifying for this remote.

What I realized is, that this remote control seems to have something 
like MAC address randomization enabled (probably for security reasons). 
It also does not propagate device information unless I start pairing 
mode. Because of MAC address randomization it also seems that pairing is 
buggy - only works sometimes with some special procedure.

I know this remote works, because if I connected in manually via 
bluetoothctl sometimes I works with enabling of notifying. Also directly 
after pairing it seemed to work.

Have you seen something like this before? What should I do?

Thanks,

Martin
