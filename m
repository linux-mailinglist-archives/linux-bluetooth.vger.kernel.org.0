AuriStream works also in HSP profile and I already implemented
negotiation for AuriStream codec for both HSP and HFP profiles.

The only missing part is to unblock kernel to allow usage of AuriStream.

AuriStream does not need HFP, it is available also in HSP. So missing
HFP should not be a blocker.

Anyway, my HFP implementation is there:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/-/merge_requests/288
https://github.com/pali/hsphfpd-prototype

And people are already testing my HFP implementation with pulseaudio
integration.

So, we can continue at kernel level, as this is the missing part right
now.
