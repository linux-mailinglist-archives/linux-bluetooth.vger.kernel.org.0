I guess you are referring to hdev->ev_q, that is only used if the
driver calls hci_recv_evt so it doesn't affect the user of
hci_recv_frame.

That might require introducing a workqueue into btusb though, but
perhaps that is not such a big deal given that we are not that
concerned on the memory usage, are there any other remarks about the
conflict resolution though? I probably will add some text to the
Kconfig option stating this is a workaround which may cause reordering
of events vs ACL data, but imo it is much cleaner then trying to
handle these races on the upper layers since they might not be limited
to just Connection Complete and Encryption Change, so instead of
papering each hole separately we just use a bigger paper to cover
everything up, it is still just a workaround so platforms would have
to decide if they want to run with it or not.
