Hi Marcel! Kernel API for userspace should be simple. Just add two
ioctls for retrieving and setting structure with custom parameters:

  syncPktTypes = 0x003F
  bandwidth = 4000
  max_latency = 16
  voice_settings = 0x63
  retx_effort = 2

Or add more ioctls, one ioctl per parameter. There is already only ioctl
for voice settings and moreover it is whitelisted only for two values.

Seems that custom codecs are already widely used, so it would be great
it Linux kernel allows to use also other codecs in future without need
to explicitly whitelist them.

> I am also curious on what the assumptions are for the USB driver alternate settings are when using a different codec.

I did all above tests and kernel changes with USB bluetooth chip which
is integrated in notebook's combo bt+wifi intel minipci-e card.
