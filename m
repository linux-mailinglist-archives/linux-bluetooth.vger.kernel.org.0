That I can't really explain, perhaps it is timing related, something
with Exchange MTU since it appears to stop the device from responding
when it happens a second time.

Not sure really, does Android/iOS Exchange the MTU? Maybe we need a
timer to start it later or perhaps the problem first response to
exchange MTU does actually use the final_mtu which makes the watch to
trigger yet another exchange to have both rx and tx MTU the same so
try with the following change:
