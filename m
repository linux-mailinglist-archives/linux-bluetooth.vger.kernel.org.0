I am a bit worried about userspace sending a 0x02 for a kernel that doesn’t understand it. Do you think the kernel can make use of this “don’t care” information? Or should we just keep it to userspace to send 0x01 / 0x00 based on its policy.

I would do “Name Request Failed” here. Just to be a bit inline what the spec term is.
