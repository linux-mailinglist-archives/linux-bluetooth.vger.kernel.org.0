I might have wrongfully assumed that a player registers a MediaPlayer2
with BlueZ to stay in sync with the playback endpoint, including
Volume. In which case the application should be aware that attenuation
is applied at the sink (hence not feasible). The other way around
mpris-proxy "re-exports" the transport volume over the MediaPlayer2
interface.

As for pulseaudio it currently doesn't do anything with the transport
volume and always applies attenuation based on a local gain. My
attempt to change that [1] is what ended up in submitting this patch
to make it possible.

Thanks, I wasn't sure about submitting a v2 to merely trim the
comments or remove them altogether. Note that the link to the mail
thread referenced with `[1]` inadvertently disappeared too.
