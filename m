Broadly, I think this is a good thing to do. My main concern is having t=
his be adequately maintained over a longer period of time.

The other thing to note is that in PipeWire, it is possible for external=
 entities to implement the equivalent of a "sink" or "source" (it's just=
 a node in PipeWire terminology), so in the long run, it might be good t=
o have a single BT audio daemon that manages A2DP and HSP/HFP..

This would also have the benefit of moving codec dependencies out of Pul=
seAudio (which I'll help mitigate in other ways within PulseAudio anyway=
).

Cheers,
Arun
