-=======================
-
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.HealthManager1
-Object path	/org/bluez/
-
-Methods		object CreateApplication(dict config)
-
-			Returns the path of the new registered application.
-			Application will be closed by the call or implicitly
-			when the programs leaves the bus.
-
-			config:
-				uint16 DataType:
-
-					Mandatory
-
-				string Role:
-
-					Mandatory. Possible values: "source",
-									"sink"
-
-				string Description:
-
-					Optional
-
-				ChannelType:
-
-					Optional, just for sources. Possible
-					values: "reliable", "streaming"
-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-
-		void DestroyApplication(object application)
-
-			Closes the HDP application identified by the object
-			path. Also application will be closed if the process
-			that started it leaves the bus. Only the creator of the
-			application will be able to destroy it.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotFound
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotAllowed

-HealthDevice hierarchy
-======================
-
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.HealthDevice1
-Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX
-
-Methods		boolean Echo()
-
-			Sends an echo petition to the remote service. Returns
-			True if response matches with the buffer sent. If some
-			error is detected False value is returned.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.OutOfRange
-
-		object CreateChannel(object application, string configuration)
-
-			Creates a new data channel.  The configuration should
-			indicate the channel quality of service using one of
-			this values "reliable", "streaming", "any".
-
-			Returns the object path that identifies the data
-			channel that is already connected.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.HealthError
-
-		void DestroyChannel(object channel)
-
-			Destroys the data channel object. Only the creator of
-			the channel or the creator of the HealthApplication
-			that received the data channel will be able to destroy
-			it.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotFound
-				         org.bluez.Error.NotAllowed
-
-Signals		void ChannelConnected(object channel)
-
-			This signal is launched when a new data channel is
-			created or when a known data channel is reconnected.
-
-		void ChannelDeleted(object channel)
-
-			This signal is launched when a data channel is deleted.
-
-			After this signal the data channel path will not be
-			valid and its path can be reused for future data
-			channels.
-
-Properties	object MainChannel [readonly]
-
-			The first reliable channel opened. It is needed by
-			upper applications in order to send specific protocol
-			data units. The first reliable can change after a
-			reconnection.

-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.NotConnected

-

-

-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.NotAcquired

-
-Properties	string Type [readonly]
-
-			The quality of service of the data channel. ("reliable"

-
-		object Device [readonly]
-
-			Identifies the Remote Device that is connected with.
-			Maps with a HealthDevice object.
-
-		object Application [readonly]
-
-			Identifies the HealthApplication to which this channel
-			is related to (which indirectly defines its role and
-			data type).
