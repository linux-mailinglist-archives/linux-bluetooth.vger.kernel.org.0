Thanks for the reply!

I agree the default should be to filter duplicates. I'd love to see
the Dbus setting actually used in the kernel. Did I find the correct
place to change? I'm not sure how it is called from bluez though.
(Maybe through the mgmt API?)

In the meantime I'm using hcidump + hcitool just fine.

Thanks,
Scott
