Greetings
My dear friend,

I know that this mail will surprise you but I implore you to take a
little of your time to go through it for the decision you take will go
a long way in determining my future. I am Mrs. Jessica Becker, from
Indonesia. I was married to the former British ambassador to Burkina
Faso for nine years before he died in 2004. We had one child who died
earlier before his late father.

My late husband deposited the sum of $5.5MUSD Five million five
hundred thousand dollars in a bank when he was alive. Recently, my
doctor told me that my days are numbered and I would not last 4 months
due to Breast cancer and kidney failure problems. Having known my
condition I decided to donate this fund to you for charity. I want you
to use this fund for orphanages, widows and the needy in the society.

I am not afraid of death because I lived a fulfilled life. I do not
need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health.
Hope to receive your response contact me with this email for more
detail: mrsjessica.becker01@gmail.com

Thanks
Mrs Jessica Becker
