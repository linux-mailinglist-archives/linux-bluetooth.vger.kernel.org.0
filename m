Glad to hear that I found the right place to ask about this. Do you
think it would be worthwhile to try to find someone to support this
feature, or is the Bluetooth team usually very short staffed?

From a user-perspective, I think that a number of existing hearing
aids support ASHA, and might never receive a firmware update for any
newer Bluetooth Audio Standards. For example, the Cochlear Nucleus 7
supports ASHA, however it has been superseded by the Cochlear Nucleus
8. I really don't know if companies have much incentive to update old
devices that many people rely on.
Considering the price tag on some of those hearing aids, I fear that
this ASHA support request might still be relevant in 10 years.

If it is indeed worthwhile to try and find someone to support this
feature, is there anything I could do to support this?
