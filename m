Hi Alain,

We can special handle them and thus also avoid the forward declaration. I am leaning towards this direction since we might want to actually split commands over multiple files to keep this file readable over time.

That means actually filling the table with NULL pointers for not supported or disable commands might be better. We could still make the read_commands function map the list of supported commands from that table.

I don’t understand this? If you would have test cases in mgmt-tester any error would be caught quickly.
