Thanks for clearyfying.

+1, it would be very good if users who do not know how to build kernels could
easily participate in testing different hacks for hardware that they have.
For example, I came to this bug because a user of the distro package of kernel
which I am maintaining asked how he can build the kernel with that patch
(https://forum.rosalinux.ru/viewtopic.php?t=10066)
I had to read this bug and then just tell the user that I do not see sense in
spending time to test this patch (include it into the package, build it, give
him instructions how to install the build). Nobody benefits from the fact that
an owner of hardware is not able to participate in hardware enablement in the
kernel.

On the other hand, opportunity to make such hacks in the kernel module config
by the user may lead to that kernel will not have many needed hacks out of the
box, users will just copy-paste device-specific solutions from the internet,
then somebody will add them to e.g. systemd's hwdb. It is not good when some
device-specific options are hard-coded in the driver and some are in other
places like systemd's hwdb.
