Thank you so much, Luiz. I appreciate it.

Yes, you're right. I counted the characteristics from the log. There
are exactly 9 services which include 92 characteristics. Do you think
it is "too many" by having 92 characteristics? Do you know if there is
any limit in BlueZ? It seems someone mentioned the number of
characteristics in this link:
https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/16233/nrf-connect-fails-when-using-many-characteristics

For the write request for the non-exist handle, I've asked our mobile
developer to check it on the mobile side.

Thanks again!
