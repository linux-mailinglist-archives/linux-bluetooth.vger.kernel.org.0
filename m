bnep is for tethering, depending on the system that might be useful,
and if you block RFCOMM you no only block usage of file transfer but
also HFP, but perhaps you don't care about those so that would be fine
to disable. Btw, for getting file sharing you would just need to
disable obexd though it doesn't seems it is a user service which you
can disable with systemctl.
