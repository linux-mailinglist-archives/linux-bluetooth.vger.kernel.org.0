In further reading, it may be that 'bluetoothctl info' should show all
the information about the BT bus but does not? Is that possible?
If I connect a keyboard, 'bluetoothctl info' shows that keyboard. If I
then connect a phone, 'btmgmt con' shows both connected, but
'bluetoothctl info' only shows the keyboard. This is why I was using
btmgmt. I have looked through the code for BlueZ and it is very
complicated. I was trying to figure out why btmgmt does not report
when run 'non interactively' and have given up. I will start
researching dbus to see if I can work with it that way.
