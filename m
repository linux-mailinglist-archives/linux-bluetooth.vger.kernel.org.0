RegisterApplication() only registers the root of a hierarchy, it
doesn't actually add any monitor, so the return of it reflects the
result of creating the root only. A client can expose some monitors
later under that root, and once bluetooth gets object-added via object
manager, it would call either Release() or Activate() to let the
client know about whether a monitor has been adopted by bluetoothd or
not.

This API is fundamentally different from the existing APIs. Currently,
in terms of LE there are 2 entries to perform scanning in BlueZ
(bluetoothd + kernel) - (1) Discovery session (with transport dual or
le) actively managed by D-Bus client (2) passive scanning managed by
kernel for auto-reconnection purpose. The intention of (1) is to find
the device ASAP, and (1) is widely used in the case where people open
a Bluetooth setting page to locate the device for pairing or
connection. The intention of (2) is to detect the LE devices for
reconnection, and this is purely done in the kernel. In addition to
(1) and (2), this API intends to provide the third entry to perform
scanning, and that is to allow D-Bus clients to monitor on LE
advertisements with RSSI thresholds and content filtering but without
the need of actively managed by D-Bus in a power efficient way (There
will be future works around offloading filtering to controllers based
on Microsoft HCI extension or Android HCI extension.) This would
empower applications which requires LE scanning in the background and
eventually trigger some events. For instance, prompting a notification
to the user if a new BLE mouse is close by and asking a user if he/she
would like to pair with it, this way, the user doesn't need to
manually look for the targeted device.
