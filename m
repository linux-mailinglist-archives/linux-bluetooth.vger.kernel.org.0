There quite a few assumption here that are not really how it is
implemented in BlueZ:

1. The L2CAP MTU is not based on the ACL link (should be relatively
easy to change)
2. L2CAP MTU is not required to be symmetric.
3. Since the ACL link is shared for all channels we shouldn't really
assume all throughput will be available
4. PA flow control is not just filling up packets and sending them
when they are full to maximize speed, instead it send packets when
necessary to maintain a constant speed so the MTU may not be fully
used, in fact trying to maximize the MTU may result in higher latency
since packets would be sent less frequently.

With this in mind I think the only thing we should look into is to
adjust the default L2CAP MTU to match the underline ACL Link, so it
maximizes throughput, the remote side may choose a different MTU which
will have to follow though.
