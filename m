Hi Jamie,

Thank you for your email. Do you know how to add "Service Changed
Indication"? We would like to support that. But we don't know how to
do it.

In fact, I posted the question before:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-bluetooth/msg89959.html. It seems
"If you are registering the services with Bluetoothd then it should
generate the service change". Our GATT server is based on
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/test/example-gatt-s=
erver.
By saying "registering the services", does it mean our code should
call "RegisterApplication()"? We did call RegisterApplication(). But
we never saw the "[ServiceChanged]"
section(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc/setting=
s-storage.txt#n321).
Please let us know if you know how to add "Service Changed
Indication".

Thanks!
Kenny

Kenny

we upgrade the build from 100 to 101, the app gets the wrong data. We looke=
d at the log. When the app tries to read temperature by using the temperatu=
re UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received the request to r=
ead the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device name" is returned t=
o the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavior as the blue=
tooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/bluetooth/[BT_MAC]/c=
ache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files in the folder=
. That means the disabled cache seems working.
