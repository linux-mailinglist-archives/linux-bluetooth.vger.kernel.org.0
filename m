  bap: Initialize bap_data for scanned device in bap_bcast_probe

By moving the bap_data initialization for a scanned device to
bap_adapter_probe() the adapter field of bap_data will already be set when
short_lived_pa_sync is called. When adapter will be changed for
bap_adapter, this will help eliminate an additional queue search (in
short_lived_pa_sync).

  bap: Replace adapter in bap_data with bap_adapter

This patch introduces the bap_adapter structure. In addition to btd_adapter
it also holds the pa_timer_id and the bcast_pa_requests queue associated
with that adapter. This enables convenient access to these variables since
the functions that need them already utilize bap_data.

For each adapter a new instance of bap_adapter is created and inserted into
the global queue, bap_adapters.

For each scanned source bap_bcast_probe searches the bap_adapters queue
based on the adapter and stores the result in the bap_data associated
with the source. Operations made on the old global queue are now made
on bap_data->bap_adapter->bcast_pa_requests queue.

While this commit sought to utilize the already existing bap_data in order
to avoid searching in queues, a lookup was still necessary in
bap_bcast_probe. Here, the bap_data for the scanned devices is created and
the bap_adapter field must be set to the appropriate value. There is no way
of getting the correct bap_adapter refference without searching the
bap_adapters queue.

  bap: Improve handling of pa_req timer

The patch handles timers on a per adapter basis.

The timer is now also started on setup_accept_io_broadcast, so
BAP_PA_BIG_SYNC_REQ can be treated if the timer is stopped in the meantime.
The timer is stopped if the bap_adapter's pa_req queue is empty.
A pa_timer_id equal to 0 means that the timer is stopped.

  bap: Remove deleted devices from pa_req queue

The bap_bcast_remove function has been updated to remove from the
pa_req queue entries of devices that were freed. pa_req that are already
in progress are treated by the bap_data_free function.

The lookup in bap_bcast_remove was necessary. The entry corresponding to
the calling service must be removed from the pa_req queue. There is no
other way to get a refference to this entry other than to search in the
queue.

This patch fixes a crash that occurs when a device is freed before the
pa_idle_timer handles it's entry in the pa_req queue. The following log
was obtained while running an Unicast setup:
