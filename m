So you are saying FEATURE_CATEGORY_2 is not defined in AVRCP 1.3
either? If the is the case we should probably make it clear on the
code with a code comment that we will be going to verify it only
because of Android using it with AVRCP 1.3, but I wonder if there is
anything in the records that you give us the information that it is
indeed Android and we should be fine doing such check since AOSP has
been doing this for a while.
