That said, while the device may be non-compliant, the device is on the market and I doubt I could get them to update the firmware as a random third party. It works on Windows, so clearly Windows doesn't have a problem with its noncompliance. So this raises the question, how should Linux handle non-compliant hardware, especially when it could easily be made to work just by bending the rules in this one instance? I can absolutely change the commit message since it's erroneous, but the question then comes down to how should it be handled at all.

>>> Brydge replied with the standard tech support "this is only supported on Windows, so there probably won't be a firmware update" reply, despite its noncompliance. And since I doubt Windows will add a change to limit it, well, that kind of limits our options here to either "enforce compliance and break non-compliant hardware" or "figure out a way to bend the rules". Given that BlueZ, upon expanding the maximum size, does successfully read the overly-long report map (it does use the read blob with offset message to get the last several bytes), it does work as intended if we ignore that specific rule. Though obviously that's up to the bluetooth maintainers to solve, so at this point I'm just tossing my two cents at it.

Is the client the device or the computer? Because the computer does successfully read past 512 bytes, and I believe it's needed for this device.

That makes sense. I can look into how to arbitrarily size that buffer.

Ah sorry, your reply was somewhat open ended and I didn't realize you wanted me to specifically look into this. As for Android, I have no idea. I can try pairing the trackpad with an Android device and seeing what happens, but I don't have anything with modern Android as it's not my day-to-day phone OS.
