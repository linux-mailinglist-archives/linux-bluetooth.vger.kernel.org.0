> Maybe I misunderstood, but just for the record: It works for me even without this hunk (with just my hunk above and the v2 bcm patch). The bdaddr via dt is used and the controller works without any userland interaction.

then please have a btmon trace and check what BD_ADDR is returned from the Read_BD_Addr command. It could be well that hdev->public_addr is not yet populated with the Broadcom specific hdev->setup and thus it does work. However what happens for the hardware that requires to re-run hdev->setup every time. As I said, we need to get the semantics figure out on what we expect things to be when these quirks are provided.

What happens on a system that has the patch and doesn’t provide an address via DT?

Just thinking out loud, maybe a hdev->pre_init callback is actually useful. Actually maybe better a hdev->post_setup. Then again, the hdev->post_init seems to have not been used actually.

Marcel
