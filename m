Hi Luiz,

Thanks for the clarification. So my guess was right that it does not
have to do with bondedness. In that case, do you think it makes sense
to add a "Bonded" flag property to org.bluez.Device1? There are some
use case flows that pair with a peer device but do not actually bond,
and just with Paired property the UI can't know whether to show this
device as "Bonded" or not.
