I looked at dundee, but it does it is separated service, not on org.ofono
So it looks like it does not fit into HSP / HFP needs.

Currently you can list all audio cards by DBus call:

"org.ofono", "/", "org.ofono.HandsfreeAudioManager", "GetCards"

and so this (or some new) call should list all HSP and HFP devices/cards
for audio application (pulseaudio).

Audio application (e.g. pulseaudio) really do not want to handle two
separate services to monitor and process HSP/HFP devices.

For audio application are HSP and HFP devices equivalent, they provide
same features: SCO socket, API for controlling microphone and speaker
gain; plus optionally specify used codec.

So having two separate services which fully divided for audio
application purpose does not make sense.

So it is possible that both HSP and HFP audio cards would be available
via one audio API? Because I do not see how it could be done via design
like dundee.

This API is unusable for both HSP and HFP audio streams. In pulseaudio
it is somehow used, but it is not suitable.

In part of designing hsphfpd I created a new DBus API for audio
application to fit for audio daemons. See org.hsphfpd.AudioAgent:
https://github.com/pali/hsphfpd-prototype/blob/prototype/hsphfpd.txt#L600-L=
663

Main objection for handsfree-audio-api.txt is that it does not provide
information about locally used codec and somehow mixes air codec and
local codec. In my hsphfpd.txt I used term "AgentCodec" for bluetooth
local codec and term "AirCodec" for bluetooth air codec format.

Another objection against handsfree-audio-api.txt API is that it is
bound to HF codecs (via number) and does not support for pass e.g. CSR
codecs.

What is completely missing in that API is controlling volume level.

And also API does not provide socket MTU information or ability to
change/specify which codec would be used.

So something like org.hsphfpd.AudioAgent API in my hsphfpd design would
be needed.

Non-audio APIs which are needed to export (for both HSP and HFP profiles):

* battery level (0% - 100%)
* power source (external, battery, unknown)
* ability to send "our laptop" battery level and power source to remote dev=
ice
* send text message to embedded display
* process button press event (exported via linux kernel uinput)

(plus all telephony related operations, but those are already supported
and provided by ofono)
