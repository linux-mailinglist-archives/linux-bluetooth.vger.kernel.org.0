Hello! Below is my email from December 2019 about a new and I think
proper way how to handle Bluetooth HSP and HFP profiles on Linux desktop
system which do not have any cellular modem or other mobile hardware.

I would like to ask audio people and teams (bluez-alsa, pipewire) and
also other people around. Are you interested in using my hsphfpd DBus
API in audio applications? And if yes, would you implement this API in
audio routing software? Do you have some comments or review of hsphfpd
API? Or would you like to somehow extend it? Also who could be
interesting in helping, developing, testing or maintaining hsphfpd
daemon itself?
