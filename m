>It only works while connected currently, 

Even then, it's unpredictable when more than one device is connected. In my case, for example, it can be my Bluetooth speaker as well as a braille device. I assumed, at first, that maybe it's the most recently connected device, but that, too, wasn't true. When I connected the second device it still changed the alias of the first device.

That, I think, would be very helpful. As I understand it, isn't set-alias only updating local (host-resident) data anyway? Also, given that set-alias isn't predictable anway when more than one device is connected, I think there definitely needs to be a way to explicitly say what one is wanting to do.
