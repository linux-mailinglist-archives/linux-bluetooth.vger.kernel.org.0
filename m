Ok, please let me know know it is merged and I will try it.

Ok, but this does not look like security issue. Just false positive
report of memory leak. Nothing highly critical.

In more cases it is needed to know what codecs and which their
configuration is supported. And dumping this is hard from btmon as it
produce tons of output (not related to this) and in some cases it does
not provide this information (e.g. when during handshake is not
enumerated all codecs).

So btmon is not replacement for avinfo. It is tool for diagnostic other
issues, e.g. those related to handshake / negotiation. So both are
required.

Ok, I have no problem to say it is "for testing" or "for debugging".
Distribution maintainers can decide where to put that package and how to
install it.

But important is that tool needs to be available to end users in some
form.
