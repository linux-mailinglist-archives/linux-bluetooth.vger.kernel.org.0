I don't think it was known issue to me. 
What was your previous kernel before switching to next-20210915?
Also, do you still have a problem after cold reboot the system? (completely shutdown and wait some
seconds before start).

From the log above, the command (0xfc09) is failing which the device may in the weird state.
