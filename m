My last suggestion was just to have a MGMT command suggesting the
kernel to load the firmware from a different location, this could be
useful for testing purpose so one can set for example an old/beta
firmware to compare for regressions or test new features that
otherwise would not be available. That said perhaps we don't actually
need a new MGMT command for doing this and just by replacing the
current file would trigger a reload but that may get tricky when if
the location does get unmonted/remounted etc.

Well if the device disappears from the host I'm not really sure how
you will be able to detect that the firmware was retained, that said
when the adapter is power up again it should be possible to query it
what firmware it is currently running and then compare with the one
from file before attempting to load it, this should also work
regardless of the underlying transport/bus so it would work regardless
of the driver in use.

It is probably simpler to just query the controller what firmware it
has before uploading a new one otherwise this gets very platform
specific, besides I don't think we would be able to tell if the USB is
connected internally or not.
