This adds bearer specific interfaces so they can properly be operated
separately.

+
+Methods
+-------
+
+void Connect() [experimental]
+`````````````````````````````
+
+Connects all BREDR profiles the remote device supports that can be connected to
+and have been flagged as auto-connectable. If only subset of profiles is already
+connected it will try to connect currently disconnected ones.
+
+If at least one profile was connected successfully this method will indicate
+success.
+
+Possible errors:

+:org.bluez.Error.Failed:

+:org.bluez.Error.AlreadyConnected:
+
+void Disconnect() [experimental]
+````````````````````````````````
+
+Disconnects all connected profiles and then terminates low-level ACL connection.
+
+ACL connection will be terminated even if some profiles were not disconnected
+properly e.g. due to misbehaving device.
+
+This method can be also used to cancel a preceding Connect call before a reply
+to it has been received.
+
+For non-trusted devices connected calling this method will disable incoming
+connections until Connect method is called again.
+
+Possible errors:
+
+:org.bluez.Error.NotConnected:
+
+Signals
+-------
+
+void Disconnected(string reason, string message) [experimental]
+```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
+
+This signal is launched when a device is disconnected, with the reason of the
+disconnection.
+
+This could be used by client application, depending on internal policy, to try
+to reconnect to the device in case of timeout or unknown disconnection, or to
+try to connect to another device.
+
+Possible reasons:
+
+:org.bluez.Reason.Unknown:
+
+:org.bluez.Reason.Timeout:
+
+	Connection timeout.
+
+	The link supervision timeout has expired for a connection or the
+	synchronization timeout has expired for a broadcast.
+
+:org.bluez.Reason.Local:
+
+	Connection terminated by local host.
+
+	The local device terminated the connection, terminated synchronization
+	with a broadcaster, or terminated broadcasting packets.
+
+:org.bluez.Reason.Remote:
+
+	Connection terminated by remote host.
+
+	This disconnection can be due to:
+
+	- the user on the remote device either terminated the connection or
+	  stopped broadcasting packets,
+
+	- the remote device terminated the connection because of low
+	  resources,
+
+	- the remote device terminated the connection because the device is
+	  about to power off.
+
+:org.bluez.Reason.Authentication:
+
+	Connection terminated due to an authentication failure.
+
+:org.bluez.Reason.Suspend:
+
+	Connection terminated by local host for suspend.

+
+The object path of the adapter the set belongs to.
+
+
+boolean Paired [readonly, experimental]

+
+Indicates if the remote device is paired to BREDR bearer.
+
+Paired means the pairing process where devices exchange the information to
+establish an encrypted connection has been completed.
+
+boolean Bonded [readonly, experimental]
+```````````````````````````````````````
+
+Indicates if the remote device is bonded to BREDR bearer.
+
+Bonded means the information exchanged on pairing process has been stored and
+will be persisted.
+
+boolean Connected [readonly, experimental]
+``````````````````````````````````````````
+
+Indicates if the remote device is currently connected to BREDR bearer.
