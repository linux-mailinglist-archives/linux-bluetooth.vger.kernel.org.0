We need to rework a little bit how the controller/target works, this
roles are actually supposed to be interpreted as client/server and
much like GATT they can be used simultaneously, so we need a target
versions and a controller version and independent supported events.
That said if the remote side controller version does not indicate 1.4
or later we obviously can't support absolute volume control as that is
reserved in earlier versions.

As I said we need to split the supported events to
ct(client)/tg(server) to avoid interpreting them as the same, it is
very odd that the remote would have different versions for each role
but it looks like this is happening in this case although it is work
confirming if the CT version if in fact 1.3 as well we cannot enable
absolute volume control as that is not supported by that version, what
we can perhaps is to detect if SetAbsoluteVolume control is used then
update the events for the session.
