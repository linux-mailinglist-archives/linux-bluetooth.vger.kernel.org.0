Great, next time just send a reminder that you are waiting for
feedback since we may have just assume you had started working
already, or hadn't been following the exact progress on the mailing
list. Another alternative is to change the status on patchwork to
something like Needs ACK so we can perhaps run some scripts that
generate email or something.
