Btw, I checked the android logs and it doesn't even do any Exchange
MTU on its own, so it just responds with 247 so I think this is
related to the peripheral inconsistency with its own MTU (247 != 252)
so it attempts to do another round of Exchange MTU while ATT request
is in place which perhaps cause it to stop responding.
