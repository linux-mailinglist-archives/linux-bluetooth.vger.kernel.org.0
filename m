Ok. I see that there is another "example" configuration for AuriStream
with just different syncPktTypes =3D 0x02BF and bandwidth =3D 3850.

So it really is not simple as it can be seen.

you have heard from others. However as stated above, I think we need to pro=
vide an array of settings that are similar defined to what the HFP spec doe=
s. Then we just load the whole set into the kernel.

CVSD and mSBC are in use. IIRC specification also mandates ulaw a alaw
codecs but I have not seen it used. Has somebody tried to implement it?
I think just replacing voice_settings should be enough as encoding /
decoding should be done in bluetooth firmware / hardware.

And then there is AuriStream which based on google results it supported
by lot of headsets.

So at least 3 different codecs are widely supported by headset.

I understood that both mSBC and AuriStream uses "transparent" mode of
transport and bluetooth chip itself does not know if it transmit mSBC or
AuriStream as it does not do any encoding...
