 guys suggesting having more than one filter, I recall commenting that with=
 ObjectManager you will be able to register multiple objects at once and if=
 Im not mistaken this is kind a must have filter otherwise you will have to=
 register filter one by one and in each and every case update the filter at=
 HCI layer, meaning not only we have several rounds trips at D-Bus layer bu=
t also at HCI, my impression is that this would not scale well at startup b=
ecause that would make application all try to register their filters at onc=
e making the whole procedure quite slow, this is actually the reason we swi=
tch to use ObjectManager since GetManagedObjects packs every object registe=
red we can then register all filters in 1 single round-trip.
There was a misunderstanding here, and I'd glad you pointed out. Your
impression was correct that we propose to allow a D-Bus client to
register multiple monitors(filters), and my above comments were around
the function RegisterMonitor() where it only allows a client to
register one monitor. Indeed RegisterMonitor has the drawback you
pointed out, so using ObjectManager is better which I also agreed
with. However, I was concerned about how we inform the client about
whether its monitors were honored or not, since there is no existing
example. One option is to introduce an extra function in
org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1, perhaps Activate(), to indicate the
monitor was adopted, and Release() should be called to inform the
failures. What do you think?

I should have listed (3), which is to adopt ObjectManager which
eliminates the need of registration. As you recalled here, we'd like
to allow one client to have multiple monitors and (3) is a better
option in this case. The only thing that bothers me is how we inform
whether a given monitor was activated or not.
