In my interpretation 'ignore the received Data PDU' may not supersed
the followin statement:

So what I think we should be doing is to ignore the received data,
meaning it should not even be processed as a signed data since we
don't understand the command, _and_ respond with ATT_ERROR_RSP,
otherwise we risk having the 30 seconds timeout and disconnecting
since the request is no responded.

Afaik we used 0xbf because that was what PTS was using.
