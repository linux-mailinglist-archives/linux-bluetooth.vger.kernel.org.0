Actually it is a good policy to provide GattProfile1 if you are
interested in enabling auto-connect, which I suppose most third-party
services would like to enable:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/doc/gatt-api.txt#n367

Note that we are doing to avoid complicate conflict resolution since
profiles by design can only be registered once that means Battery
sources will also be limited to one per profile, Im fine if you choose
not to have this integration in the first version .
