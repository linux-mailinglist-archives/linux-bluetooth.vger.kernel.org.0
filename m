It would also be useful to know what external components, or internal
plugins you expect to feed this API.

Apparently HSP/HFP, for example, provide more information that what can
be expressed with the Battery1 API, whether it is charging or not, or
whether a battery level is unknown, etc.

So I would say that, even if the current battery API is extended, we
need to make sure that the D-Bus API to feed new data is extensible
enough to allow new properties, and they don't need to be added
separately to org.bluez.BatteryProvider1 or org.bluez.Battery1.
