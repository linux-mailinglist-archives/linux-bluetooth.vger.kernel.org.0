Great, thank you. I'll look into the MGMT api in the coming days. That
said, is it a problem to use both api's (MGMT/DBus) concurrently from
the same app? My application supports both connected BLE sensors as
well as BLE beacon type sensors. If possible I can handle them in two
different threads, but the DBus thread for connected sensors would
still occasionally need to scan for new sensors (using the DBus
discovery call) and would still need to get characteristic changed
callbacks as well.

Out of curiosity though, is the behavior I'm seeing normal? Or is the
sensor doing something improper possibly? Seeing as the packets aren't
duplicates why would they be filtered (or are they just not being
received to begin with for some reason)? The 11 second interval seems
kind of strange. Anyway, thanks again for the help! Chris
