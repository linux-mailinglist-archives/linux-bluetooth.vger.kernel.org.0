My understanding is that the HOG service can get added to any other
device through a service change notification or other means, so I
don't think it is a safe assumption that this code will only execute
if a user explicitly requested it.

You are correct that the change may cause a device to stop working if
it was using HOGP without bonding, but this would also be a non
compliant device and one that compromises the system's security.  I'm
ok if we make this a configuration in case you believe the
compatibility with these sorts of scenarios must be maintained.
