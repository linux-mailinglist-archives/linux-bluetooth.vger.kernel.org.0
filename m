The spec doesn't allow mixing values of different sizes, or does it
first return the 16 bits one and then later 3 are return in a
different response?

Well if the device is returning mixed UUID sizes then there is nothing
we can do to figure out since as you said there is only one len so all
elements should be of the same length, perhaps Android doesn't use
Read By Type procedure and discover them, anyway it is perhaps worth
notifying them about this problem given that it doesn't seem to
conform to the spec.
