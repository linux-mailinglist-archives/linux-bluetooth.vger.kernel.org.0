we could try to reject the pairing. However keep in mind that our inquiry c=

The general idea is to both "try" to protect against a downgrade
attack but also to encrypt all channels (other than SDP) if SSP is
supported by the remote.  If the later is already handled, we just
need to make sure we use all available signals that the remote side
supports SSP.  Receiving an EIR is a valid signal, the absence of EIR
doesn't imply the remote doesn't support SSP.

Right, but if we do have the EIR signal, then we should expect SSP to
be used.  It is legitimate, in my interpretation, to fail anything
less than SSP in that case.
