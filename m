So I assume this is using the experimental IPSP support with Zephyr as
peripheral? Usually, the Linux side is quite a bit more complex so it
is not surprising it can take more time but not 1 sec. so it got to be
something that is causing the extra lag, perhaps you can paste the
actual commands you are using to ping one another.
