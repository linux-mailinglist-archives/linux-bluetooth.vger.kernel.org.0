Hi Luiz,

I considered having such an approach that gives exception to some
profile to not claim exclusive access. However, I think that this
approach has a drawback that it can only be guaranteed to work
correctly for profiles that contain only read-only attributes. Any
profile that contains writable attributes, naturally, cannot be
guaranteed to always work correctly (as is the case with the Battery
profile). Therefore, the usefulness of that feature will be very
limited.

I also considered the benefits of the AllowInternalProfiles approach:
* Applications can also have control over any profile, not just
Battery profile. For example, if in the future BlueZ has more internal
profiles, like (Blood Pressure Profile or any other profile that may
contain writable attributes), we can guarantee that applications can
still opt to have access to that profile, without relying on a profile
being "safe" to be shared by both BlueZ's internal and external
handlers.
* This has an added security benefit: applications which operate on a
specific GATT profile will not unintentionally activate internal
profiles such as HOG (which is able to hijack input control of the
host). This is the correct and expected behavior of Android apps that
connect over GATT and get access to a GATT profile.

Therefore I think that this approach, although more complex, has
longer lasting benefits. Let me know if you have any objection to
having such a feature.
