So you are also suggesting that a system crash is less of a problem
then a regression? I'm not opposed to having a fix to the regression,
but it needs to come without the reintroduction of a system crash,
period. The no-regression policy only applies as long as it doesn't
cause even bigger problems like a system crash or a security problem
for example, otherwise we need to find a better option, which in my
opinion is to rework the driver shutdown logic, if I had the hardware
and could experiment with I would just attempt to detect the hardware
mode at probe and if that fails force a reset and start over since the
setup stage exists exactly for the driver to have exclusive access to
the controller it can in theory power cycle the controller.
