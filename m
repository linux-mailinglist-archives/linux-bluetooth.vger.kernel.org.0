Well you are not making it any better if you are still claiming the
maintainer doesn't know what doing when you should really be thanking
him for looking into this, now perhaps his changes doesn't address a
particular problem you are trying to solve nevertheless it is worth
incorporating his changes in your set and then have yours on top
without reverting his changes? Can you do that or there is something
fundamentally broken with that.

Everyone here probably have their own assignments, so you are getting
sort of _free_ consultancy, so please instead continue disputing what
we are suggesting at least try to incorporate the suggested changes,
we want to have it fixed properly so we don't have to keep receiving
the same changes over and over again which is a waste of everyone's
time, including yours.
