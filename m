We might need to remove the version number here since there is no
equivalent on UUID, in fact friendly names may be a bad idea after all
since for new profiles we may not have a friendly name to do the
translation and since this is property that would be hard to notify
the provider that we don't understand what is the Source while UUIDs,
if well formatted, should not have this problem so Id just get rid of
the use of friendly names altogether and expect the Source to be a
128bits UUID in string format.

We should probably mention this expects an object implementing
ObjectManaged in order to list the Battery1 provider.

If this is on the client the object path does not necessarily need to
follow our object hierarchy.
