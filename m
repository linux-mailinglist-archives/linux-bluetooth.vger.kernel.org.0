This is a great technical criticism of the driver, and I think you 
deserve that explanation.

However, with the driver already in the kernel, shouldn't the bias be 
toward mitigating the extremely bad UX and not hold users hostage for 
the bad design which has already been approved and landed in the kernel?

I agree that Qualcomm should get flack for this, however, the UX problem 
can be mitigated with a logic fix that doesn't make the init/shutdown 
design problem any worse than it currently seems to be. I mean, wouldn't 
this logic have to exist somewhere even if it weren't the shutdown path?

If you are trying to use this as leverage to get Qualcomm to do a bigger 
thing (redesign the init/shutdown logic), I do think that tactic 
needlessly puts users in the crossfire. I can totally understand why 
you'd do it. I am just suffering the crossfire in the meantime, and it 
doesn't feel great.
