We should probably tight this to UUID instead.

Not sure if you were followinging the monitor patches, for registering
objects we do prefer the ObjectManager style so multiple provider can
be registered at once, also we may want to tight the control of
battery provider with Profile API so we guarantee that the same entity
that handles the profile connection is the one providing the battery
status.

Perhaps we should make this use the same interface as we use for the
daemon itself (Battery1) and the Source there as well. Last but not
least, have you explored the idea of exporting the battery status over
uHID? If I got this right this would aggregate the status of different
sources and then make the daemon expose them, which while it works for
now it means that upper layer have different interfaces for handling a
battery status of something plugged over USB and over Bluetooth.
