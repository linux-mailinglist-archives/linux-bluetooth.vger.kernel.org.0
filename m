This might be a kernel bug then, the UUID shall be omitted if not
supported, if it is being returned by MGMT_OP_READ_EXP_FEATURES_INFO
then bluetoothd will consider it supported thus causing the problem
you are describing:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git/tree/net/bluetooth/mgmt.c#n3919

It looks like only it is indeed a problem for
simult_central_periph_uuid, so we shall probably change it to:

diff --git a/net/bluetooth/mgmt.c b/net/bluetooth/mgmt.c
index c8baf6141026..28b873df9084 100644
--- a/net/bluetooth/mgmt.c

@@ -3921,7 +3921,7 @@ static int read_exp_features_info(struct sock
*sk, struct hci_dev *hdev,
        }

-       if (hdev) {
+       if (hdev & test_bit(HCI_QUIRK_VALID_LE_STATES, &hdev->quirks)) {
                if (hci_dev_le_state_simultaneous(hdev))
                        flags = BIT(0);
                else
