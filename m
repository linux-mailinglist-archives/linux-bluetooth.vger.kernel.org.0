I couldn't remember exactly why I chose HPM, and so I recreated what
I'd done.  I looked to see what modes were available by git grepping
the kernel sources and since they are in
include/dt-bindings/regulator/qcom,rpmh-regulator.h with a comment
explaining what each mode is, I picked HPM since it starts it at the
full rated current.  As to why I chose the others... it was based on
SMPS being mentioned in that comment block.  Since I wasn't sure what
PFM is (and admittedly, did not look it up) I skipped it.

And you are right, we probably don't want to yank that regulator out
from under the wifi...  will add that in v7, so I guess for v7 we want
HPM, LPM, AUTO with AUTO being initial.  I guess I was trying to think
that RET would allow as little power usage as possible when bluetooth
isn't in use.
