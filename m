I wonder if we do Add Advertisement Monitor Pattern or Add Advertisement Monitor With Pattern.

Why 8 Octets? How many do you expect? I would do 16-bit.

I would have a generic Remove Adveristement Monitor

> +	Command Parameters:	Remove_All (1 Octet)

Skip the Remove_All. If you give Monitor_Count == 0, then it will remove all of them. This is how we have done the others.

> +				Monitor_Count (2 Octets)
> +				Monitor_Handle[i] (8 Octets)

Return values are not needed here.

You are missing signals for Monitor Added and Monitor Removed.

And we are also missing a command for reading the basic supported features. Like we do for Advertising as well.
