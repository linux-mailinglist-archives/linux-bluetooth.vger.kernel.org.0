I guess we could introduce a some sort of conflict frag but Im afraid
that would complicate things a lot because then we need to have some
sort o priority as well, also HSP is so ancient I would basically
consider it deprecated by now, the only reason to use is if you don't
have a Telephony (e.g. oFono) subsystem to handle the HFP properly.
