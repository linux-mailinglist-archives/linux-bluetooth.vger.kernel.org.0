For some reason they tend to squat on the very first CSR/
Cambridge Silicon Radio VID/PID instead of paying fees.

This is an extremely common problem; the issue goes as back as 2013
and these devices are only getting more popular, even rebranded by
reputable vendors and sold by retailers everywhere.

So, at this point in time there are hundreds of modern dongles reusing
the ID of what originally was an early Bluetooth 1.1 controller.

Linux is the only place where they don't work due to spotty checks
in our detection code. It only covered a minimum subset.

So what's the big idea? Take advantage of the fact that all CSR
chips report the same internal version as both the LMP sub-version and
HCI revision number. It always matches, couple that with the manufacturer
code, that rarely lies, and we now have a good idea of who is who.

Additionally, by compiling a list of user-reported HCI/lsusb dumps, and
searching around for legit CSR dongles in similar product ranges we can
find what CSR BlueCore firmware supported which Bluetooth versions.

That way we can narrow down ranges of fakes for each of them.

e.g. Real CSR dongles with LMP subversion 0x73 are old enough that
     support BT 1.1 only; so it's a dead giveaway when some
     third-party BT 4.0 dongle reuses it.

So, to sum things up; there are multiple classes of fake controllers
reusing the same 0A12:0001 VID/PID. This has been broken for a while.

Known 'fake' bcdDevices: 0x0100, 0x0134, 0x1915, 0x2520, 0x7558, 0x8891
  IC markings on 0x7558: FR3191AHAL 749H15143 (???)

Changes in v3:
* Find an even better way of detecting which type is which; use the
  best parts of v1 and v2 and combine them with previous feedback.
* Additionally, detect fakes by comparing against a BlueCore
  firmware numbers and their supported protocol versions.
* Introduce HCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_ERR_DATA_REPORTING and use it on all
  fake chips. It doesn't seem to cause any drawback, and if we
  make it too specific a lot of these chips won't work at all,
  so it's probably better than nothing. Other user reported
  being able to finally pair with their stereo A2DP speaker
  with this fix.
* Limit the use of btusb_setup_csr() only to cover 0A12:0001.
* Use bt_dev_warn for the fake detection notice.
* Remove all other noisy bt_dev_info() calls.

Changes in v2:
* Find a better way of detecting which type is which; scrap the wonky
  >=Bluetooth 1.2 protocol check and instead do what's described above.
* Move all the quirk logic to btusb_setup_csr(), simplify it a bit.
* Use a switch statement and list all the known broken bcdDevice
  instead of trying to penalize the real CSR devices.
* Add two bt_dev_info() prints because this may be important in the
  future, given the amount of variables we are playing with here.
* Try to keep my comments within a 80-column limit.

Now I'm able of pairing with Android devices, A2DP headphones,
DS4 controllers and more; whereas previously set up failed
and userland software couldn't even scan with it.

This patch probably uncovers other quirks in some of these
previously *unusable* dongles, so it's probably a good start
point so that other fixes can be implemented on top.

Looking forward to fine-tune these checks in the future.
Let me know what you think.
