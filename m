-BlueZ D-Bus GATT API description
-********************************
-
-GATT local and remote services share the same high-level D-Bus API. Local
-refers to GATT based service exported by a BlueZ plugin or an external
-application. Remote refers to GATT services exported by the peer.
-
-BlueZ acts as a proxy, translating ATT operations to D-Bus method calls and
-Properties (or the opposite). Support for D-Bus Object Manager is mandatory for
-external services to allow seamless GATT declarations (Service, Characteristic
-and Descriptors) discovery. Each GATT service tree is required to export a D-Bus
-Object Manager at its root that is solely responsible for the objects that
-belong to that service.
-
-Releasing a registered GATT service is not defined yet. Any API extension
-should avoid breaking the defined API, and if possible keep an unified GATT
-remote and local services representation.
-
-Service hierarchy
-=================
-
-GATT remote and local service representation. Object path for local services
-is freely definable.
-
-External applications implementing local services must register the services
-using GattManager1 registration method and must implement the methods and
-properties defined in GattService1 interface.
-
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.GattService1
-Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX/serviceXX
-
-Properties	string UUID [read-only]
-
-			128-bit service UUID.
-
-		boolean Primary [read-only]
-
-			Indicates whether or not this GATT service is a
-			primary service. If false, the service is secondary.
-
-		object Device [read-only, optional]
-
-			Object path of the Bluetooth device the service
-			belongs to. Only present on services from remote
-			devices.
-
-		array{object} Includes [read-only, optional]
-
-			Array of object paths representing the included
-			services of this service.
-
-		uint16 Handle [read-write, optional] (Server Only)
-		              [read-only] (Client Only)
-
-			Service handle. When available in the server it
-			would attempt to use to allocate into the database
-			which may fail, to auto allocate the value 0x0000
-			shall be used which will cause the allocated handle to
-			be set once registered.
-
-
-Characteristic hierarchy
-========================
-
-For local GATT defined services, the object paths need to follow the service
-path hierarchy and are freely definable.
-
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1
-Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX/serviceXX/charYYYY
-
-Methods		array{byte} ReadValue(dict options)
-
-			Issues a request to read the value of the
-			characteristic and returns the value if the
-			operation was successful.
-
-			Possible options: "offset": uint16 offset
-					  "mtu": Exchanged MTU (Server only)
-					  "device": Object Device (Server only)
-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed(string ecode)
-					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotPermitted

-					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported
-
-			Possible Error Code: string 0x80 - 0x9f
-
-		void WriteValue(array{byte} value, dict options)
-
-			Issues a request to write the value of the
-			characteristic.
-
-			Possible options: "offset": Start offset
-					  "type": string
-						Possible values:
-						"command": Write without
-						response
-						"request": Write with response
-						"reliable": Reliable Write
-					  "mtu": Exchanged MTU (Server only)
-					  "device": Device path (Server only)
-					  "link": Link type (Server only)
-					  "prepare-authorize": True if prepare
-							       authorization

-					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported
-
-			Possible Error Code: string 0x80 - 0x9f
-
-		fd, uint16 AcquireWrite(dict options) [optional]
-
-			Acquire file descriptor and MTU for writing. Only
-			sockets are supported. Usage of WriteValue will be
-			locked causing it to return NotPermitted error.
-
-			For server the MTU returned shall be equal or smaller
-			than the negotiated MTU.
-
-			For client it only works with characteristic that has
-			WriteAcquired property which relies on
-			write-without-response Flag.
-
-			To release the lock the client shall close the file
-			descriptor, a HUP is generated in case the device
-			is disconnected.
-
-			Note: the MTU can only be negotiated once and is
-			symmetric therefore this method may be delayed in
-			order to have the exchange MTU completed, because of
-			that the file descriptor is closed during
-			reconnections as the MTU has to be renegotiated.
-
-			Possible options: "device": Object Device (Server only)
-					  "mtu": Exchanged MTU (Server only)
-					  "link": Link type (Server only)
-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported
-
-		fd, uint16 AcquireNotify(dict options) [optional]
-
-			Acquire file descriptor and MTU for notify. Only
-			sockets are support. Usage of StartNotify will be locked
-			causing it to return NotPermitted error.
-
-			For server the MTU returned shall be equal or smaller
-			than the negotiated MTU.
-
-			Only works with characteristic that has NotifyAcquired
-			which relies on notify Flag and no other client have
-			called StartNotify.
-
-			Notification are enabled during this procedure so
-			StartNotify shall not be called, any notification
-			will be dispatched via file descriptor therefore the
-			Value property is not affected during the time where
-			notify has been acquired.
-
-			To release the lock the client shall close the file
-			descriptor, a HUP is generated in case the device
-			is disconnected.
-
-			Note: the MTU can only be negotiated once and is
-			symmetric therefore this method may be delayed in
-			order to have the exchange MTU completed, because of
-			that the file descriptor is closed during
-			reconnections as the MTU has to be renegotiated.
-
-			Possible options: "device": Object Device (Server only)
-					  "mtu": Exchanged MTU (Server only)
-					  "link": Link type (Server only)
-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported
-
-		void StartNotify()
-
-			Starts a notification session from this characteristic
-			if it supports value notifications or indications.
-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotPermitted
-					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotConnected
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported
-
-		void StopNotify()
-
-			This method will cancel any previous StartNotify
-			transaction. Note that notifications from a
-			characteristic are shared between sessions thus
-			calling StopNotify will release a single session.
-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
-
-		void Confirm() [optional] (Server only)
-
-			This method doesn't expect a reply so it is just a
-			confirmation that value was received.
-
-			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
-
-Properties	string UUID [read-only]
-
-			128-bit characteristic UUID.
-
-		object Service [read-only]
-
-			Object path of the GATT service the characteristic
-			belongs to.
-
-		array{byte} Value [read-only, optional]
-
-			The cached value of the characteristic. This property
-			gets updated only after a successful read request and
-			when a notification or indication is received, upon
-			which a PropertiesChanged signal will be emitted.
-
-		boolean WriteAcquired [read-only, optional]
-
-			True, if this characteristic has been acquired by any
-			client using AcquireWrite.

-
-			True, if notifications or indications on this
-			characteristic are currently enabled.
-
-		array{string} Flags [read-only]
-
-			Defines how the characteristic value can be used. See
-			Core spec "Table 3.5: Characteristic Properties bit
-			field", and "Table 3.8: Characteristic Extended
-			Properties bit field".
-
-			The "x-notify" and "x-indicate" flags restrict access
-			to notifications and indications by imposing write
-			restrictions on a characteristic's client
-			characteristic configuration descriptor.

-GATT Manager hierarchy
-======================
-
-GATT Manager allows external applications to register GATT services and
-profiles.
-
-Registering a profile allows applications to subscribe to *remote* services.
-These must implement the GattProfile1 interface defined above.
-
-Registering a service allows applications to publish a *local* GATT service,
-which then becomes available to remote devices. A GATT service is represented by
-a D-Bus object hierarchy where the root node corresponds to a service and the
-child nodes represent characteristics and descriptors that belong to that
-service. Each node must implement one of GattService1, GattCharacteristic1,
-or GattDescriptor1 interfaces described above, based on the attribute it
-represents. Each node must also implement the standard D-Bus Properties
-interface to expose their properties. These objects collectively represent a
-GATT service definition.
-
-To make service registration simple, BlueZ requires that all objects that belong
-to a GATT service be grouped under a D-Bus Object Manager that solely manages
-the objects of that service. Hence, the standard DBus.ObjectManager interface
-must be available on the root service path. An example application hierarchy
-containing two separate GATT services may look like this:
-
--> /com/example
-  |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager
-  |
-  -> /com/example/service0
-  | |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
-  | |   - org.bluez.GattService1
-  | |
-  | -> /com/example/service0/char0
-  | |     - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
-  | |     - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1
-  | |
-  | -> /com/example/service0/char1
-  |   |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
-  |   |   - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1
-  |   |
-  |   -> /com/example/service0/char1/desc0
-  |       - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
-  |       - org.bluez.GattDescriptor1
-  |
-  -> /com/example/service1
-    |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
-    |   - org.bluez.GattService1
-    |
-    -> /com/example/service1/char0
-        - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
-        - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1
-
-When a service is registered, BlueZ will automatically obtain information about
-all objects using the service's Object Manager. Once a service has been
-registered, the objects of a service should not be removed. If BlueZ receives an
-InterfacesRemoved signal from a service's Object Manager, it will immediately
-unregister the service. Similarly, if the application disconnects from the bus,
-all of its registered services will be automatically unregistered.
-InterfacesAdded signals will be ignored.

+
+Description
+===========
+
+GATT Manager allows external applications to register GATT services and
+profiles.
+
+Registering a profile allows applications to subscribe to *remote/client*
+services.
+
+Registering a service allows applications to publish a *local/server* GATT
+service, which then becomes available to remote devices. A GATT service is
+represented by a D-Bus object hierarchy where the root node corresponds to a
+service and the child nodes represent characteristics and descriptors that
+belong to that service. Each node must implement one of
+**org.bluez.GattService(5)**, **org.bluez.GattCharacteristic(5)** or
+**org.bluez.GattDescriptor(5)** interfaces, based on the attribute it
+represents. Each node must also implement the standard D-Bus Properties
+interface to expose their properties. These objects collectively represent a
+GATT service definition.
+
+To make service registration simple, **bluetoothd(8)** requires that all objects
+that belong to a GATT service be grouped under a D-Bus Object Manager that
+solely manages the objects of that service. Hence, the standard
+DBus.ObjectManager interface must be available on the root service path. An
+example application hierarchy containing two separate GATT services may look
+like this:
+
+.. code-block::
+
+    -> /com/example
+      |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager
+      |
+      -> /com/example/service0
+      | |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
+      | |   - org.bluez.GattService1
+      | |
+      | -> /com/example/service0/char0
+      | |     - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
+      | |     - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1
+      | |
+      | -> /com/example/service0/char1
+      |   |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
+      |   |   - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1
+      |   |
+      |   -> /com/example/service0/char1/desc0
+      |       - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
+      |       - org.bluez.GattDescriptor1
+      |
+      -> /com/example/service1
+        |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties

+            - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties
+            - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1
+
+When a service is registered, **bluetoothd(8)** will automatically obtain
+information about all objects using the service's Object Manager. Once a service
+has been registered, the objects of a service should not be removed. If
+**bluetoothd(8)** receives an InterfacesRemoved signal from a service's Object
+Manager, it will immediately unregister the service. Similarly, if the
+application disconnects from the bus, all of its registered services will be
+automatically unregistered. InterfacesAdded signals will be ignored.
