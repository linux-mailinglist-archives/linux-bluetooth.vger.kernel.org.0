I tried adding the folks on the To: line who were involved in writing 
the driver. Having had much luck yet.

This is the actual message I am getting to while trying to build the 
kernel. I turned off the CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF option to try to get a 
build. That seems to have worked.

Is there some secret method of getting more debug messages from the kernel.

Also, is there some way to get access to the qualcomm docs for this 
hardware? I am not some official kernel dev. Do you know anyone that 
could help with that?
