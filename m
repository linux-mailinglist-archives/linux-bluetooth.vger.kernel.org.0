Hi Luiz,

Sorry for being unclear.

Should be unnecessary due to the check you mentioned below.

The problem occurs when the device is paired and is currently
connected, then Adapter.RemoveDevice is called. This would make us
disconnect the device first before actually removing the device.
During this disconnection phase, there is a chance the adapter is
powered off.

If this happens, we would still attempt to remove the device anyway.
No problem on the user space, but it will fail on the kernel side (as
per the API, it requires adapter to be on). The check you mentioned is
unfortunately not executed during this phase.

About the timer, I didn't have the exact issue you described, but this
version of patch might have other problems with it, because the timer
would still be running when we do the early return from
btd_adapter_remove_device. Although nothing will happen if the timer
runs out when the power is still off (we would just do the early
return again), but it might be unpleasant if the adapter is re-powered
and the timer kicks off to remove the device.
