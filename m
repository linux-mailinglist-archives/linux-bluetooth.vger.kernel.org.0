Hi Carey,

In principle I agree here. High connection interval has its downsides,
low connection interval also. Just curios: What are the numbers about
power consumption here? A few mA? I have only compared these values on
peripherals running on low-power SoCs like e.g. the nrf stuff from nordic.
I see around 1 mA difference there with a power consumption besides of that=
=20
usually measured in the =B5A range. Never tested these things on a linux ma=
chine.

The point here is that with this patch there is insufficient control
about this. Yes, there is the debugfs interface.

But if you want to provide a driver to a gatt service living on top of
bluetoothd dbus api? Ask people to not use distribution kernels?
What options do you have?
using the monitor interface to sniff the connection handle and then
call hci_le_conn_update() to set things?

I think that these things should be part of the  dbus api provided
by bluetoothd so that a driver could decide and having defaults outside
of such a dark corner like the debug fs.

Or just maybe a flag allowing such behavior?

Well, all these things are important, but are new features but there is a
problem:
The kernel patch has gone into the stable trees and from there into distrib=
utions,
so how can these new features flow down the same path.
