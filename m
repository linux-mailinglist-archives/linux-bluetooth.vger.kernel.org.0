Is there a way the kernel could identify those as a fake/clone, and adverti=
se
this in dmesg? It would make debugging user reports much easier as we could
just say "get an original instead of a fake/clone".

This chipset (and clones) seems to be very common, almost any USB dongle I =
can
find has this chipset (or a clone) inside (according to lsusb), and some wo=
rk,
others don't. This chip is even in dongles of manufactures who somewhat cla=
im
that the Bluetooth dongle is completely made by themselves (with no mention=
 of
the CSR chip inside), or maybe these are just fake dongles with a brand nam=
e on
it, I'm not sure. It's difficult to get something else even if you're not
looking explicitly for CSR.
