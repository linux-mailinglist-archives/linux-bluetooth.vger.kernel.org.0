-BlueZ D-Bus Advertisement Monitor API Description
-*************************************************
-
-This API allows an client to specify a job of monitoring advertisements by
-registering the root of hierarchy and then exposing advertisement monitors
-under the root with filtering conditions, thresholds of RSSI and timers
-of RSSI thresholds.
-
-Once a monitoring job is activated by BlueZ, the client can expect to get
-notified on the targeted advertisements no matter if there is an ongoing
-discovery session (a discovery session is started/stopped with methods in
-org.bluez.Adapter1 interface).
-
-Advertisement Monitor hierarchy
-===============================
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1 [experimental]
-Object path	freely definable
-
-Methods		void Release() [noreply]
-
-			This gets called as a signal for a client to perform
-			clean-up when (1)a monitor cannot be activated after it
-			was exposed or (2)a monitor has been deactivated.
-
-		void Activate() [noreply]
-
-			After a monitor was exposed, this gets called as a
-			signal for client to get acknowledged when a monitor
-			has been activated, so the client can expect to receive
-			calls on DeviceFound() or DeviceLost().
-
-		void DeviceFound(object device) [noreply]
-
-			This gets called to notify the client of finding the
-			targeted device. Once receiving the call, the client
-			should start to monitor the corresponding device to
-			retrieve the changes on RSSI and advertisement content.
-
-		void DeviceLost(object device) [noreply]
-
-			This gets called to notify the client of losing the
-			targeted device. Once receiving this call, the client
-			should stop monitoring the corresponding device.
-
-Properties	string Type [read-only]
-
-			The type of the monitor. See SupportedMonitorTypes in
-			org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitorManager1 for the available
-			options.
-
-		Int16 RSSILowThreshold [read-only, optional]
-
-			Used in conjunction with RSSILowTimeout to determine
-			whether a device becomes out-of-range. Valid range is
-			-127 to 20 (dBm), while 127 indicates unset.
-
-		Int16 RSSIHighThreshold [read-only, optional]
-
-			Used in conjunction with RSSIHighTimeout to determine
-			whether a device becomes in-range. Valid range is
-			-127 to 20 (dBm), while 127 indicates unset.
-
-		Uint16 RSSILowTimeout [read-only, optional]
-
-			The time it takes to consider a device as out-of-range.
-			If this many seconds elapses without receiving any
-			signal at least as strong as RSSILowThreshold, a
-			currently in-range device will be considered as
-			out-of-range (lost). Valid range is 1 to 300 (seconds),
-			while 0 indicates unset.
-
-		Uint16 RSSIHighTimeout [read-only, optional]
-
-			The time it takes to consider a device as in-range.
-			If this many seconds elapses while we continuously
-			receive signals at least as strong as RSSIHighThreshold,
-			a currently out-of-range device will be considered as
-			in-range (found). Valid range is 1 to 300 (seconds),
-			while 0 indicates unset.
-
-		Uint16 RSSISamplingPeriod [read-only, optional]
-
-			Grouping rules on how to propagate the received
-			advertisement packets to the client. Valid range is 0 to
-			255 while 256 indicates unset.
-
-			The meaning of this property is as follows:
-			0:
-				All advertisement packets from in-range devices
-				would be propagated.
-			255:
-				Only the first advertisement packet of in-range
-				devices would be propagated. If the device
-				becomes lost, then the first packet when it is
-				found again will also be propagated.
-			1 to 254:
-				Advertisement packets would be grouped into
-				100ms * N time period. Packets in the same group
-				will only be reported once, with the RSSI value
-				being averaged out.
-
-			Currently this is unimplemented in user space, so the
-			value is only used to be forwarded to the kernel.
-
-		array{(uint8, uint8, array{byte})} Patterns [read-only, optional]
-
-			If the Type property is set to "or_patterns", then this
-			property must exist and have at least one entry in the
-			array.
-
-			The structure of a pattern contains the following:
-			uint8 start_position
-				The index in an AD data field where the search
-				should start. The beginning of an AD data field
-				is index 0.
-			uint8 AD_data_type
-				See https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/
-				assigned-numbers/generic-access-profile/ for
-				the possible allowed value.
-			array{byte} content_of_pattern
-				This is the value of the pattern. The maximum
-				length of the bytes is 31.
-
-Advertisement Monitor Manager hierarchy
-=======================================
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitorManager1 [experimental]
-Object path	/org/bluez/{hci0,hci1,...}
-
-Methods		void RegisterMonitor(object application)
-
-			This registers the root path of a hierarchy of
-			advertisement monitors.
-			The application object path together with the D-Bus
-			system bus connection ID define the identification of
-			the application registering advertisement monitors.
-			Once a root path is registered by a client via this
-			method, the client can freely expose/unexpose
-			advertisement monitors without re-registering the root
-			path again. After use, the client should call
-			UnregisterMonitor() method to invalidate the
-			advertisement monitors.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
-					 org.bluez.Error.Failed
-
-		void UnregisterMonitor(object application)
-
-			This unregisters a hierarchy of advertisement monitors
-			that has been previously registered. The object path
-			parameter must match the same value that has been used
-			on registration. Upon unregistration, the advertisement
-			monitor(s) should expect to receive Release() method as
-			the signal that the advertisement monitor(s) has been
-			deactivated.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist
-
-Properties	array{string} SupportedMonitorTypes [read-only]
-
-			This lists the supported types of advertisement
-			monitors. An application should check this before
-			instantiate and expose an object of
-			org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1.
-
-			Possible values for monitor types:
-
-			"or_patterns"
-				Patterns with logic OR applied. With this type,
-				property "Patterns" must exist and has at least
-				one pattern.
-
-		array{string} SupportedFeatures [read-only]
-
-			This lists the features of advertisement monitoring
-			supported by BlueZ.
-
-			Possible values for features:
-
-			"controller-patterns"
-				If the controller is capable of performing
-				advertisement monitoring by patterns, BlueZ
-				would offload the patterns to the controller to
-				reduce power consumption.

+This API allows an client to specify a job of monitoring advertisements by

+of RSSI thresholds.
+
+Once a monitoring job is activated by **bluetoothd(8)**, the client can expect

+uint16 RSSIHighTimeout [read-only, optional]
+````````````````````````````````````````````
+
+	The time it takes to consider a device as in-range. If this many
