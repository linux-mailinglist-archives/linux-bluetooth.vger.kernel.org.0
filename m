Can you say something more about what the protocol looks like? Is there
some common framing that can/should be stripped by the driver in both
modes?

The 'type' attribute is intended to reveal the GNSS receiver type
(class) as a hint to user space to avoid having to detect it at runtime
using heuristics.

It does not reflect which mode is currently active for receivers that
provide both a vendor specific protocol and NMEA (e.g. u-blox
receivers).

User space can currently switch modes at will by writing to /dev/gnss0
as Tony mentioned.

It may or may not make sense to make sure a particular mode is set
during probe, for example, if there's no real use for the proprietary
protocol and everyone would just switch away from it immediately.
