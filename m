But we do not know what features can agent handle. There is no API for
it.

Agent which works in AG role accept connections from remote HF role.
Agent register to bluez with AG role features. HF and AG features are
different and bluez has absolutely no idea what features can agent
accept from remote device.

And what would happen if both agent and remote device supports 1.8?

When remote device do specified features, default one should be used.
So this cannot be solved with some default values in bluez.
