Hi Marek,

That's interesting and means we are dealing with two distinct problems
here. No matter what order I flip controller/target_init in
AVRCP_REGISTER_NOTIFICATION is always received after both functions
complete. handle_vendordep_pdu is registered before these
initialization functions making this possible though. I wonder if PDUs
are dropped when the callback is registered later, after init. Perhaps
controller/target_init need to be split in two, a static
initialization part based on the remote profile version followed by
registering this callback and finally functions that send commands to
the remote like avrcp_get_capabilities.

That means your phone reports an AVRCP remote version of at least
0x104, otherwise supported_events would not contain
AVRCP_EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED. Can you validate this in wireshark or
DBG("%p version 0x%04x", ...) in the logs? I'm seeing:

    profiles/audio/avrcp.c:target_init() 0x5614a2cbab70 version 0x0103

Either way the split Luiz and I mentioned mean one variant of
supported_events (the one relevant for registering
AVRCP_EVENT_VOLUME_CHANGED) is initialized in controller_init.

Quite the contrary, in my previous mail I attempted to explain
multiple times that the CT/TG designation in the spec is used for
initiator and target respectively, not the AVRCP controller and target
profile. Indeed, depending on the transaction either side (controller
or target) can be the initiator (CT). In other words CT and TG are
_not_ abbreviations for the controller and target profile.

Correct, yet the A2DP sink will always take on the AVRCP controller
profile where the phone being the A2DP source takes the AVRCP target
profile.
