-BlueZ D-Bus Agent API description
-**********************************
-
-
-Agent Manager hierarchy
-=======================
-
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.AgentManager1
-Object path	/org/bluez
-
-		void RegisterAgent(object agent, string capability)
-
-			This registers an agent handler.
-
-			The object path defines the path of the agent
-			that will be called when user input is needed.
-
-			Every application can register its own agent and
-			for all actions triggered by that application its
-			agent is used.
-
-			It is not required by an application to register
-			an agent. If an application does chooses to not
-			register an agent, the default agent is used. This
-			is on most cases a good idea. Only application
-			like a pairing wizard should register their own
-			agent.
-
-			An application can only register one agent. Multiple
-			agents per application is not supported.
-
-			The capability parameter can have the values
-			"DisplayOnly", "DisplayYesNo", "KeyboardOnly",
-			"NoInputNoOutput" and "KeyboardDisplay" which
-			reflects the input and output capabilities of the
-			agent.
-
-			If an empty string is used it will fallback to
-			"KeyboardDisplay".
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
-
-		void UnregisterAgent(object agent)
-
-			This unregisters the agent that has been previously
-			registered. The object path parameter must match the
-			same value that has been used on registration.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist
-
-		void RequestDefaultAgent(object agent)
-
-			This requests is to make the application agent
-			the default agent. The application is required
-			to register an agent.
-
-			Special permission might be required to become
-			the default agent.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist
-
-
-Agent hierarchy
-===============
-
-Service		unique name
-Interface	org.bluez.Agent1
-Object path	freely definable
-
-Methods		void Release()
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			unregisters the agent. An agent can use it to do
-			cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister the
-			agent, because when this method gets called it has
-			already been unregistered.
-
-		string RequestPinCode(object device)
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			needs to get the passkey for an authentication.
-
-			The return value should be a string of 1-16 characters
-			length. The string can be alphanumeric.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
-			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled
-
-		void DisplayPinCode(object device, string pincode)
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			needs to display a pincode for an authentication.
-
-			An empty reply should be returned. When the pincode
-			needs no longer to be displayed, the Cancel method
-			of the agent will be called.
-
-			This is used during the pairing process of keyboards
-			that don't support Bluetooth 2.1 Secure Simple Pairing,
-			in contrast to DisplayPasskey which is used for those
-			that do.
-
-			This method will only ever be called once since
-			older keyboards do not support typing notification.
-
-			Note that the PIN will always be a 6-digit number,
-			zero-padded to 6 digits. This is for harmony with
-			the later specification.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
-			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled
-
-		uint32 RequestPasskey(object device)
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			needs to get the passkey for an authentication.
-
-			The return value should be a numeric value
-			between 0-999999.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
-			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled
-
-		void DisplayPasskey(object device, uint32 passkey,
-								uint16 entered)
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			needs to display a passkey for an authentication.
-
-			The entered parameter indicates the number of already
-			typed keys on the remote side.
-
-			An empty reply should be returned. When the passkey
-			needs no longer to be displayed, the Cancel method
-			of the agent will be called.
-
-			During the pairing process this method might be
-			called multiple times to update the entered value.
-
-			Note that the passkey will always be a 6-digit number,
-			so the display should be zero-padded at the start if
-			the value contains less than 6 digits.
-
-		void RequestConfirmation(object device, uint32 passkey)
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			needs to confirm a passkey for an authentication.
-
-			To confirm the value it should return an empty reply
-			or an error in case the passkey is invalid.
-
-			Note that the passkey will always be a 6-digit number,
-			so the display should be zero-padded at the start if
-			the value contains less than 6 digits.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
-			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled
-
-		void RequestAuthorization(object device)
-
-			This method gets called to request the user to
-			authorize an incoming pairing attempt which
-			would in other circumstances trigger the just-works
-			model, or when the user plugged in a device that
-			implements cable pairing. In the latter case, the
-			device would not be connected to the adapter via
-			Bluetooth yet.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
-			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled
-
-		void AuthorizeService(object device, string uuid)
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			needs to authorize a connection/service request.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
-			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled
-
-		void Cancel()
-
-			This method gets called to indicate that the agent
-			request failed before a reply was returned.
