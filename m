It is not only pulseaudio, but also other applications which are going
to use HSP and HFP profiles. Having more services just complicates
things. Most majority of devices support both HSP and HFP profiles and
target application would need to start merging these two services into
one to create object overview of one device.

I do not see search why to complicate it for HSP and HFP applications
users to divide these two profiles into separate services and daemons.
Due to these problems I designed my hsphfpd to handle both profiles as
for audio applications they are fully equivalent and for other are very
similar. In that way hsphfpd provides all supported HSP and HFP profiles
and therefore taraget application do not have to introspect lot of
places and then merge information together. Otherwise every one HSP/HFP
application need to do this.

Used by who? Gateway role is fully broken and client (hfp) role is used
probably only by some power users. Also there is no support for mSBC in
pusleaudio.

So, no, really it is not used.

This cannot be truth as probably every bluetooth HW is doing on-the-fly
conversion between CVSD and PCM. I was not able to find HW which allows
me to send raw CVSD samples...

But OK, I understand that just for one codec (or two?) API was designed
very simple and nobody though about possibility about usage of HW
encoders also for non-CVSD codecs. For that time in past, it make sense.

This is still not enough. Audio application (e.g. pulseaudio) need to
register AgentCodec, not AirCodec. And current API is somehow mixed.
Audio application needs to know what is the format which bluetooth chip
sends to userspace (PCM? mSBC? CVSD? PCMA? AuriStream?) and which format
bluetooth chip expects. I named this AgentCodec.

And it is fully different of codec negotiated by HFP protocol. Here is
negotiated codec which is transmitted over the air. Hence the name
AirCodec.

HFP daemon needs to negotiate AirCodec via HF codec and audio daemon
(e.g. pulseaudio) needs to negotiate AgentCodec via HFP daemon.

So API in that form is unusable. And e.g. API which I designed for
hsphfpd Audio Agent is needed.

MTU is needed also for mSBC codec if encoding is done in software
(pulseaudio). Without it, this wide band support in ofono is unusable
for pulseaudio.

And also API extension for choosing codec. Also for choosing if software
of hardware encoding would be used. We know that there are lot of broken
devices in different way and it is really needed for either blacklist
some codec or switch between hw and sw encoding if something strange
happen. Without it pulseaudio is not going to support more codes then
default required (CVSD).

Ok. Are you going to implement them?
I think that all of these are missing parts in ofono and something which
is needed to be implemented for desktop/laptop HSP and HFP profile
support.
