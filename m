my aim is to known which commit cause this issue ASAP since i very care
about QCA6390, now i got it, so don't need any further actions any more.

i did not notice above info before my last reply, i did not see such
info in this discussion thread until your reply as well.

BTW, you maybe add relevant link if you are referring something from
another discussion thread.

you maybe ignore that all my reply come from icloud.com, so you maybe
not associate it with qualcomm, it is the first time for icloud.com to
join BT relevant discussion. (^^)
