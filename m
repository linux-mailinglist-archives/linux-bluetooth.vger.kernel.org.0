Subject: [RFC BlueZ] Bluetooth: Add support for Mesh Scanning and Sending
Date:   Fri, 17 Dec 2021 13:25:42 -0800
Message-Id: <20211217212542.372210-1-brian.gix@intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.31.1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-bluetooth.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-bluetooth@vger.kernel.org

Adds two new MGMT Commands:
	- MESH_MODE - Enable Mesh Mode with either Active or Passive
	scanning for a list of AD Types (Mesh and/or Extended Mesh).

	- MESH_SEND - Send a requested Mesh Packet on a non-resolvable
	random address, perhaps with a specific fine-timed delay.

Adds one new MGMT Event:
	- MESH_DEVICE_FOUND - Returned when Mesh is enabled, and one of
	  the requested AD Types is detected in an incoming
	  Advertisement.

+	Command Code:		0x0057
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Enable (1 Octet)
+				Active (1 Octet)
+				AD Types { }
+	Return Parameters:	Available Slots (1 Octet)
+
+	This command Enables or Disables Mesh Mode. Mesh mode, when enabled
+	keeps the controller passivly or actively scanning for LE Advertising
+	messgaes. To enable Mesh, LE must be enabled.
+
+	The Active parameter when set to 0x01, will cause the controller to
+	perform active scanning, as opposed to passive scanning, when the
+	parameter is set to 0x00.
+
+	The AD Types parameter, if present, will filter Advertising and Scan
+	responses by AD type. reponses that do not contain at least one of the
+	requested AD types will be discarded. response results will be delivered
+	with the Mesh Device Found event.
+
+	This command may be called redundantly to switch between Active and
+	Passive scanning, without disabling Mesh mode. If Mesh mode is disabled,
+	all active outbound Mesh Packet Send requests will return fail codes.
+
+	The returned parameter Available Slots returns the number of

+Mesh Packet Send Command
+==============================================================
+
+	Command Code:		0x0058
+	Controller Index:	<controller id>
+	Command Parameters:	Reference (1 Octets)
+				Instant (4 Octets)
+				Delay (2 Octets)
+				Count (1 Octets)
+				Data { }
+	Return Parameters:	Status, Reference Value
+
+	This command sends a Mesh Packet as a NONCONN LE Advertisement. Mesh
+	mode must be enabled.
+
+	The Reference value is Host defined, and will be returned with the
+	status, so that the Host may have multiple requests outstanding at
+	the same time. The Reference value will not be interpretted by the
+	kernel.
+
+	The Instant parameter is used in combination with the Delay
+	parameter, to finely time the sending of the Advertising packet. It
+	should be set to the Instant value tag of a received incoming
+	Mesh Device Found Event. It is only useful in POLL-RESPONSE situations
+	where a response must be sent within a negotiated time window. The value
+	of the Instant parameter should not be interpreted by the host, and
+	only has meaning to the controller.
+
+	The Delay parameter, if 0x0000, will cause the packet to be sent
+	immediately, or at the earliest opportunity. If non-Zero, it will
+	attempt to send the packet the requested number of milliseconds after
+	the instant in time represented by the Instant parameter.
+
+	The Count parameter must be sent to a non-Zero value indicating the
+	number of times this packet will be sent before transmission completes.
+	If the Delay parameter is non-Zero, then Count must be 1 only.
+
+	The Data parameter is an octet array of the AD Type and Mesh Packet.
+
+	This command will return only after the outbound packet has been sent,
+	or it fails.
