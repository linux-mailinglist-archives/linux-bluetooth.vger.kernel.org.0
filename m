 That said, while the device may be non-compliant, the device is on the mar=
ket and I doubt I could get them to update the firmware as a random third p=
arty. It works on Windows, so clearly Windows doesn't have a problem with i=
ts noncompliance. So this raises the question, how should Linux handle non-=
compliant hardware, especially when it could easily be made to work just by=
 bending the rules in this one instance? I can absolutely change the commit=
 message since it's erroneous, but the question then comes down to how shou=
ld it be handled at all.

well, that kind of limits our options here to either "enforce compliance an=

ven that BlueZ, upon expanding the maximum size, does successfully read the=
 overly-long report map (it does use the read blob with offset message to g=

but I don't have anything with modern Android as it's not my day-to-day pho=

Well iOS would do as well, what Im after is if that is in fact never
enforced by other major OS, I do see there have been some tickets
created about that already so Im trying to get some response, please
forward this to the manufactures:

In the meantime there is yet another device that appear to have similar pro=
