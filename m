I'm looking at Voice Setting parameters and it is possible to set Input
Coding Format to alaw and also Air Coding Format to alaw. It is not
Transparent Air mode, so above problem with profile interoperability
does not have to be there. So in theory it should be possible to
configure bluetooth chip to pass-thru alaw data without re-encoding
them. So after new API for "unlocking" other non-whitelisted Voice
Settings is there, this can start to be tested...

Apparently there is no CVSD Input Coding Format in Voice Setting, so
CVSD codec data cannot be pass-thru to bt chip via existing Setup
Synchronous Connection. But there is Enhanced Setup Synchronous
Connection command which does not use Voice Setting structure which
seems to be more powerfull in codec handling.
