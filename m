Luiz, thanks for having a go.

what you say is correct:
from the recent package update that file was reinstalled as:-
KERNEL=3D=3D"hiddev*", ATTRS{idVendor}=3D=3D"046d", ATTRS{idProduct}=3D=3D"=
c70[345abce]|c71[3bc]", \
 RUN+=3D"hid2hci --method=3Dlogitech-hid --devpath=3D%p"

And I have changed it to:
KERNEL=3D=3D"hiddev*", ATTRS{idVendor}=3D=3D"046d", ATTRS{idProduct}=3D=3D"=
c70[345abce]|c71[3]", \
 RUN+=3D"hid2hci --method=3Dlogitech-hid --devpath=3D%p"

which works again.

This has been wrong for quite some time (many years) but was correct at som=
e stage prior (distant past) but I believe it was put back in when the --me=
thod=3Dlogitech-hid switch was added (incorrectly). That switch does not wo=
rk for this device.

As previously mentioned I have been on the Debian forums several times but =
it has been effectively ignored. So have been working around it ever since =
I installed bluez package for other things. The recent update gave me the i=
mpetus to give this another go more directly.
