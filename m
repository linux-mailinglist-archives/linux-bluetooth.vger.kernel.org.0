I fill like repeating myself over and over, but here it goes again,
endpoints are not supposed to initiate connection which is the reason
why in PA the card is created only when a profile is connected, and no
we are not going to introduce feature like this to counter bugs where
HFP is left connect while A2DP isn't, etc. It is very important to
note that while we are caching the remote endpoints we never assume
they are valid before we connect and confirm they are still available.

Not gonna happen.
