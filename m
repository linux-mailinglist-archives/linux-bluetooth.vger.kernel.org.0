Yes, that is truth.

Yes.

No, this is not how hsphpfd is suppose to work. Look at design & API:
https://github.com/pali/hsphfpd-prototype/blob/prototype/hsphfpd.txt

ofono would be there only in agent role, similar like audio daemon
(pulseaudio/pipewire/bluez-alsa). So it would look like:

              +---- <-> ofono
              |
bluez5 <-> hsphfpd
              |
              +---- <-> pulseaudio / pipewire / bluez-alsa

You can connect / disconnect ofono without loosing audio functionality.
(Or connect / disconnect audio daemon without loosing telephony modem
functionality.)

hsphfpd is central point for all HSP and HFP related operations and
applications.

With hsphfpd involved, you would never talk with ofono. Also ofono is
not required for this setup.

HSP/HFP AT commands needed for audio handling are already designed to be
handled by hsphfpd daemon. Please look at details.

This is reason why I started this discussion :) and proposed my hsphfpd
daemon.

There is no context switching in hsphfpd design once audio connection is
established. From hsphfpd you get native audio SCO socket, so audio is
not routed throw hsphfpd nor bluez daemons. Socket directly pass data to
kernel.

The only what is needed is that "other stack" just export DBus interface
for registering HSP and HFP profiles according to bluez documentation.
Then hsphfpd would work with that bluetooth "other stack".

AT commands are covered by hsphfpd. Encoding / decoding of data is up to
the application agent. Please look into hsphfpd.txt document.

But creating a library which would do encoding and decoding of audio
data and acts as a hsphfpd audio application agent is possible. If other
projects want to use it (e.g. pulseaudio, bluez-alsa, pipewire, jack) we
can start a separate discussion about API of such library. I guess that
more audio daemons would be different requirements and to be usable in
all projects we need to cover all of them.

> * HFP/HSP commands handling

This is already covered by hsphpfd.

> * telephony handling

In hsphfpd this is exported to external telephony agent. Possibly ofono
or modem manager (whatever project will implement needed API and
connects to hsphfpd daemon).

This is part of hsphfpd daemon, please look at hsphfpd.txt if it covers
your needs. Btw, phone dialing is part of telephony handling.
