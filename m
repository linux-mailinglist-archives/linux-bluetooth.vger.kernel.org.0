So this will get a little bit confusing if we don't have a HFP
implementation that actually does implement the profile parts to
enable wideband speech so I wonder if we should rename it to the
underline feature it enables, that said this sort of feature is
probably easier to be queried over the socket itself rather than over
D-Bus so it can be used in conjunction with the likes of BT_VOICE,
also regarding the erroneous data should that be also enabled by the
HFP profile, because depending on the platform it may not support
wideband speech so enabling erroneous data automatically may result in
artifacs, specially in cases where the codecs don't have error
correction or data loss concealment to handle data with possible error
and lost data respectively, btw we don't seem to be parsing the
SCO/ESCO flags and even if we do this properly we need to find a way
to notify them over the socket so things like plc works properly.
