Maybe I should write that above setsockopt(BT_VOICE_SETUP=14) call is a
replacement for setsockopt(BT_VOICE=13). It is used in the same way.

Well, when using HFP profile, specifying coding format is needed for
every connection based on how both sides (AG and HF) decide on the final
codec. Also e.g. user can decide to choose / change different codec (via
audio application e.g. pulseaudio) if current selected is broken / does
not work with particular headset (yes, there are such).

And QoS is bound with air coding format for some codecs (e.g.
AuriStream), so it should not be separated.

Plus old bluetooth adapters do not support hardware mSBC encoding, so
for mSBC you need to specify both local part and air coding format. So
based on this I do not suggest to split this structure. Otherwise it
just complicate userspace application support, which will *always* need
to call methods to set all those settings. Basically I do not see a
reason for (new/modern) audio application when it should want to
configure/change just local part or just air coding format. Audio
application needs to always configure all of them when creating a new
connection.

Just to note when nothing is specified, then default settings are used
like before (so CVSD HW encoding), to not break any existing
applications.

Also setsockopt(BT_VOICE=13) is still support and it would be
(internally by kernel) converted to setsockopt(BT_VOICE_SETUP=14) call,
so again no application would be broken which still would use just
BT_VOICE=13.

No, there is no such limitation. Codec setting, like for
setsockopt(BT_VOICE=13) is per-socket.

See usage, setsockopt is set for file descriptor of created SCO socket.

It is *not* global like "hciconfig hci0 voice" command.

There is no need to do any limitation. Codec setting is per connection
and every SCO connection can configure its own codec. So there is
out-of-box multidevice support via this API and (Enhanced) Setup
Synchronous Connection HCI command.

And to make it clear usage for accepted from listening socket is
following:

int listening_fd = socket(PF_BLUETOOTH, SOCK_SEQPACKET, BTPROTO_SCO);
bind(listening_fd, ...);
int one = 1;
setsockopt(listening_fd, SOL_BLUETOOTH, BT_DEFER_SETUP, &one, sizeof(one));
listen(listening_fd, ...);

int fd = accept(listening_fd, ...);
setsockopt(fd, SOL_BLUETOOTH, BT_VOICE_SETUP, &voice_setup, sizeof(voice_setup));
char dummy;
read(fd, &dummy, 1);

It is exactly same as for setsockopt(BT_VOICE=13). You first need to
enable BT_DEFER_SETUP which allows to configure per-accepted-socket SCO
configuration of socket. Last read syscall cause to establish new SCO
connection with specified voice_setup parameters (exactly like of
BT_VOICE=13 is used).
