The way I would have done this is to make use of recvmsg and then add
the packet flags as msg_flags:

   recvmsg()
       The recvmsg() call uses a msghdr structure to minimize the
number of directly supplied arguments.  This structure is defined as
follows in <sys/socket.h>:

           struct iovec {                    /* Scatter/gather array items */
               void  *iov_base;              /* Starting address */
               size_t iov_len;               /* Number of bytes to transfer */
           };

           struct msghdr {
               void         *msg_name;       /* Optional address */
               socklen_t     msg_namelen;    /* Size of address */
               struct iovec *msg_iov;        /* Scatter/gather array */
               size_t        msg_iovlen;     /* # elements in msg_iov */
               void         *msg_control;    /* Ancillary data, see below */
               size_t        msg_controllen; /* Ancillary data buffer len */
               int           msg_flags;      /* Flags on received message */
           };

But to make this backward compatible I would recommend adding a
socketopt that enables this new behavior and in case there is more
than one SCO socket those that did not use the sockopt should probably
drop packets with error or lost data so they work as without erroneous
data report since in that case the application will likely be using
regular reads it won't be able to detect the use of msg_flags.
