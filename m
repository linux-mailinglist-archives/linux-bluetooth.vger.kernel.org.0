If you have one method that works and one that fails, you should use
btmon to compare the exact write payloads. I don't know about GoPro so
can't help what kind of messages it expects.

You can see that it's the controller that first notifies of the
disconnection with the reason "Connection Timeout" (in a start
encryption result, as indicated by the result code). So likely it's
due to one of the reasons I wrote about earlier. Another reason for
connection timeout is if the firmware is buggy or just drops the
connection for example when you suddenly power off the device. What
also could happen is, during encryption setup, is if both devices
believe they share the same encryption key, but in fact they for some
reason have two different keys stored, then the peripheral will drop
the connection with the reason "Connection terminated due to MIC
failure" while the central will eventually get a "Connection Timeout".
