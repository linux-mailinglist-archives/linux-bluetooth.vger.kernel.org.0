-=======================
-
-Service		org.bluez.obex
-Interface	org.bluez.obex.AgentManager1
-Object path	/org/bluez/obex
-
-Methods		void RegisterAgent(object agent)
-
-			Register an agent to request authorization of
-			the user to accept/reject objects. Object push
-			service needs to authorize each received object.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.obex.Error.AlreadyExists
-
-		void UnregisterAgent(object agent)
-
-			This unregisters the agent that has been previously
-			registered. The object path parameter must match the
-			same value that has been used on registration.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.obex.Error.DoesNotExist
-
-
-Agent hierarchy
-===============
-
-Service		unique name
-Interface	org.bluez.obex.Agent1
-Object path	freely definable
-
-Methods		void Release()
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			unregisters the agent. An agent can use it to do
-			cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister the
-			agent, because when this method gets called it has
-			already been unregistered.
-
-		string AuthorizePush(object transfer)
-
-			This method gets called when the service daemon
-			needs to accept/reject a Bluetooth object push request.
-
-			Returns the full path (including the filename) or the
-			folder name suffixed with '/' where the object shall
-			be stored. The transfer object will contain a Filename
-			property that contains the default location and name
-			that can be returned.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.obex.Error.Rejected
-			                 org.bluez.obex.Error.Canceled
-
-		void Cancel()
-
-			This method gets called to indicate that the agent
-			request failed before a reply was returned. It cancels
-			the previous request.
