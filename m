This is actually on purpose since the volume notification indicates
the volume at the device side we don't want to change the player
volume as well as it would most likely result in duplicating the
volume change both at sink and source, note that the likes of handling
the transport like pulseaudio would already notify the device volume
level change without actually applying any change to the volume
locally.
