You are quite likely conflating two problems. The ubsan issue you quoted
was always there and the patch I just sent fixes it, but it almost
certainly always worked fine in practice without ubsan.

The Bluetooth problem you are referring to is likely *specific to
Bluetooth LE devices* and the regression was introduced by 288c90224e
and fixed by 41e9cdea9c, which is also in 6.5.11 and 6.6.1.

If Bluetooth is broken in *some other way* in 6.6.1 then we need a
proper report or a bisect. Your logs don't show any issues other than
the ubsan noise, which is not a regression.
