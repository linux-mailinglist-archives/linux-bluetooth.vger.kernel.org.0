Hello John,

There are various Python examples available in the tree under the test
directory:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/test

There are a number of Python libraries that have been implemented to
help with what you are looking to do.
There is a list of some of them at:
https://github.com/ukBaz/python-bluezero/wiki

I hope that helps.

Regards,
Barry
