  org.bluez.MediaEndpoint: removing BAP streams with ClearConfiguration

Allow user to remove specific streams by calling
ClearConfiguration(transport_path) on the endpoint.  If the path is the
endpoint path instead, clear all streams associated with the endpoint.

  org.bluez.MediaEndpoint: add client role Reconfigure

Add a simple way for the sound server to reconfigure a BAP unicast
endpoint, by calling org.bluez.MediaEndpoint.Reconfigure().

This shall destroy all streams of the endpoint, and restart the
SelectProperties() configuration flow from the beginning.

Since it may be necessary to reconfigure multiple endpoints at once to
correctly make bidirectional CIS, add Defer argument to just mark eps
for configuration.

In future, org.bluez.MediaEndpoint.SetConfiguration() could be changed
to handle unicast in the same way as broadcast: only create streams.
This allows sound server to have full control over stream configuration
itself, and not rely on bt_bap_select().

After bap_abort_stream_req() no req callbacks for stream shall be

  shared/bap: fix ucast client ASE usage

The ucast client stream design has issues:

* Assuming lpac & rpac pair uniquely identifies a stream.  False for
  AC6(i) and other multi-stream configs.

* No way for ASE in Config state be configured with different codec.

* Assuming ASE enters idle state at end of stream life cycle.  False for
  some devices like Sony headsets, which always cache codec config so
  RELEASING -> CONFIG always, never RELEASING -> IDLE, so ASE never go
  IDLE again.

* Assuming Unicast Client upper layer always creates streams for all
  non-idle ASEs.  False, as when switching between duplex & sink-only
  modes, only some streams shall be used regardless of whether Server is
  caching config or not.

In practice, these currently prevent reconfiguring ASEs on devices which
cache codec config, and multi-stream configs work only accidentally (and
fail if server does Config codec itself, like some devices do).

Minimally fixed design for Unicast Client streams:

Streams correspond 1-to-1 to ASEs in non-IDLE state.

Track explicitly which streams upper level is using:

- bt_bap_stream_new() always makes new stream with client_active=3Dtrue
- bt_bap_stream_discard() releases stream and marks client_active=3Dfalse=


Streams (ASEs) with no active client may be reused when upper level asks
for a new stream.

Streams with no active client may have their lpac changed.  The
need_reconfig state is a bit ugly, but not really avoidable.

Streams with no active client shall be ignored when constructing
bidirectional CIS pairs.

Streams shall clear transport and detach io on RELEASING. (cf BAP v1.0.2
=C2=A75.6.6). Also unlink them since QoS is gone at that point.

Streams shall have transport only for >=3D QOS state.  (Server streams
work differently, which makes sense since upper level cannot acquire
them before they are pending.)

  bap: do not try QoS before links are updated & io created

In setup config, QoS must be done after corresponding bap_state
callback, because stream links are updated only at that point.  If the
ASE was in CONFIG state before reconfiguration, this gets done in wrong
order.

Track explicitly that bap_state() is done after bt_bap_stream_config(),
before proceeding to QoS.

completion or failure, instead of hardcoding DBus reply.

First, all associated streams are closed. After that, endpoints marked
for reconfiguration are reconfigured using the same flow as in the
initial configuration.

Delay creating IO if setup reconfiguration is ongoing.

TODO: this is not fully right, also new stream QoS should be delayed if
CIG is active, so that it doesn't get assigned into a new CIG which
controllers may not support
