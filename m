Yes, I see. Also there are devices without HFP support, only with HSP.
pulseaudio support also these devices and pulseaudio is not going to
drop support for them. Last time when I looked at ofono, it has no HSP
support. Is ofono going to add support for HSP?

Ok. I agree that functionality from my hsphfpd prototype can be "moved"
to ofono.

But would you accept patches which exports DBus API e.g. for displaying text
on HFP headset with embedded display? Or patches which implements 3
different way for reporting battery level status of HFP headset? And API
for sending "computer battery level" to HFP headset? Or implementing
setup of SCO sockets (via RFCOMM layer) for custom codecs? Or exporting
uinput linux device for button press events? Because all these
functionalities looks like not relevant to telephony / modem stack and
for me it seems that ofono is not target application which should be
interested in implementing it.

I disagree here. Primary purpose of HFP for desktop users is ability to
use bluetooth's microphone. And not telephony stack and its complicated
features like call hold and others, which are in HFP used and
implemented probably only in car kits.

Ok, can you please provide exact steps how to do it, including
activating of bidirectional audio stream?

Because from all information which I got, and also from talk with other
people, I think it really is not possible.

Also official pulseaudio documentation mention that you need phone sim
simulator for this purpose, see:

https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documentation/User/Blu=
etooth/#index5h2

Yes! For connecting bluetooth headset you need HFP AG implementation.

And I guess this is the reason why simulator is needed. HFP headset acts
as a "client" for modem. Therefore on desktop / laptop you need to
implement "modem server" which will be used by HFP headset "client".

And phone simulator is doing exactly this "modem server", it is
simulator of modem.

If it is really possible (and need for phone simulator as described
above is not required) then there is completely missing documentation
how to do it. And how should be audio server (pulseaudio) configured to
work in this way.
