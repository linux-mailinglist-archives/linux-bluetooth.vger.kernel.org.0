In these routines (which are called on RegisterNotification response,
and SetAbsoluteVolume response, so BlueZ as CT), the player is
from target_get_player, so it's one of the RegisterPlayer() players for
Bluez as TG.

There's indeed a separate set of "proxy" players in 
session->controller->players, but their avrcp_player_cb is NULL and
don't have set_volume defined or appear as TG players.

From my current reading of the spec, there's no correspondence to audio
transports. One might understand it so that volume is specific to a
certain player on TG, but as TG is supposedly sink, it's sounds like it
intended to be a single device volume.

Sorry, yes, I meant 4b6153b0501c.

Best,
