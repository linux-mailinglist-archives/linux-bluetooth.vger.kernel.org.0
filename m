We may need to do some changes, for instance it is probably better to
make input plugin register its profiles within src/profile.c like we
do with externa profiles, in fact this would probably be a nice thing
to do for every profile actually, so we have a src/profile.c managing
all our sockets instead of each plugin doing its own thing. Regarding
profiles, LE and Classic use the same term but they mean different
things, in LE there are GATT Services (which include attributes, etc)
and then a profile which normally consist of client procedures, on the
other hand in Classic the term Profile is used for both client and
server and uses SDP to declare it, RegisterProfile is actually meant
for Classic/SDP registration while in LE we have RegisterApplication
which has its own object tree to represent GATT services and
attributes.
