This actually sounds like a bug in the kernel, either it should
cleanup the existing sockets or not disconnect them at all if there is
a new connection in place, otherwise it quite possible that there will
be many more races like this. Have you tried doing something similar
with BR/EDR, we actually depend on the socket being disconnected to
notify all the profiles so then can cleanup properly.

Another way to resolve this is to cleanup earlier at
device_remove_connection since we know at that point ATT will be
disconnected.
