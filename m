Support no, understand yes, it must understand all the values exposed
by the remote features if it support the version, and here Im
suggesting just the default values so it surprises me the sort
assertive tone.

Yes it needs to be backward compatible, but what Im saying is that the
agent need to be able to understand the features bits, how else would
then it goes and enable events, etc, via AT commands, and actually
although your protocol can handle 1.7 the remote side may only be
handling 1.5 features then essentially all features are limited to
1.5. Im not sure why we always come to this bits and pieces in our
discussions, it is as if I was not involved with any of this in the
past, I know pretty well how HFP operates, in fact most profiles work
in the same way regarding the version, the record only indicates what
is maximum supported version and all version previous to that shall
work so at protocol level you just downgrade the version according to
what both sides can supports, what we cannot do is to upgrade the
version so features from e.g. 1.8 shall never creep into the features
bits since they wouldn't be compatible.

Yes and in order to construct a valid SDP record it needs to
understand the version and features.

Read above, we still need to construct a valid SDP record, this
shouldn't be a big change compared to what you already have all we
would be doing is:

1. version =3D MIN(remote_version, local_version)
2. features =3D  default_features(version)
3. features =3D get_features()
4. NewConnectiion(version, features)

Then all the agents out there would don't need to keep doing on their own.
