The way I see this is only really a problem for unstable uapi headers,
so in case we are early adopters it is probably a good practice to
have a copy to make sure the packages can be compiled on systems
without these headers, once these headers becomes stable and most
distros already ship with them, imo, there is no reason to keep the
copies as they are not subject to major redesign and normally just
receive minor updates for bugs, etc,  which is the kind of change we
would likely miss given we were no longer paying attention to changes
on those headers as they are considered stable.

Also we might as well include these headers to be check like we do in
the following check:
