this is the part that I don’t grok. So how do we reset the USB power while still keeping it. Does this mean we see a USB Disconnect and USB Reconnect happening, but the second time around we enter btusb_probe() we come from a total different state?

And how does it make sense that calling hdev->shutdown() ends up in btusb_remove() + btusb_probe(). I am confused.

Marcel
