I was trying to implement this on the kernel to match the MTU size of
L2CAP with ACL but the packet type current in use by the connection is
not exposed in the connection complete, or at least I couldn't any
reference to it, we could possibly expose the packet types via socket
option as well but changing it at runtime is probably not a good idea.
