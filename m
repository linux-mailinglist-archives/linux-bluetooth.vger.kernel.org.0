+cc'ing a bunch of editors who have previously touched Absolute Volume.

Hi Pauli,

Thanks for your patience - I wasn't available to reply last week.  Also
apologies for having the wrong In-reply-to in my mail, marc.info
substitutes @/. in email ddressses with () and ! and I missed it while
importing.  Will import directly from lore.kernel.org next time around.

It indeed seems like the target player is wrongly used in certain cases,
for example also when handling notifications (which should be sent from
TG->CT).  Surprisingly the last commit touching these is a crash-fix
that checks session->target for NULL, and mentions a crash exactly
because both roles might not always be supported (by the remote device,
hence the counterpart is not initialized in BlueZ).

Following your SetAbsoluteVolume response example, it also becomes clear
from avrcp_set_volume that the target should only be used in the notify
scenario - the remainder of this function uses the controller before
eventually sending the command and subsequently (seemingly wrongly)
updating the target player in the avrcp_handle_set_volume
response-handler.

However, according to 179ccb936 ("avrcp: Set volume if volume changed
event is registered") the peer doesn't need to have a target profile at
all (hence the ->controller on the BlueZ side) to control volume.
This patch seems suspicious to me and I don't even see it on the mailing
list nor GitHub to figure out if there has been any conversation prior
to merging.
Most notably registered_events should be checked when sending a
VolumeChanged notification, not when sending the SetAbsoluteVolume
command.

Perhaps the author was hit by the same versioning issue on Android where
the target profile is definitely available but advertises a version of
the spec that did not document Absolute Volume (both notification and
Set functionality).  The device however appropriately declares
FEATURE_CATEGORY_2 which mandates support for absolute volume.
I have sent a patch to support this case previously [1] but it has not
yet been looked at, Luiz should I resend this?

All in all, perhaps we should also introduce a bunch of null-checks
against ->target and ->controller respectively to ensure certain
functions are only handled for the right role?

In that case shall we move it all outside of the players and into the
device (after maintainers acknowledge this, too)?
