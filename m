For diagnosic I think we would be better off with some dedicated
interface to query this, as for the later the information we are
giving does not actually tell anything about the codec support, which
was part of my original argument that for the likes of HFP and other
profiles using it it might not be enough and they still need to use
BT_VOICE in order to enable the use of custom codecs, if you take
ofono for example it does implement support for wideband speech
already and it would completely disregard this property which can give
the false impression that wideband speech cannot be activated when in
fact it can, it just don't have erroneous data reporting enable, so
perhaps we should indicate the actual adapter feature (e.g.
ErrnoneousDataReporting) not the profile feature here, so the profile
implementation can check weather this would disable use of wideband
speech or not, futhermore we should probably report the errors back to
the SCO socket or is that just for diagnostic and cannot be used to
adjust the streaming?
