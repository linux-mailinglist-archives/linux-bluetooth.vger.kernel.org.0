Thank you for your concerns.  I as the author of AVRCP Absolute Volume 
support in PulseAudio made sure to insert these equality checks against 
the last known Absolute Volume value (separate from user-visible volume 
managed by PA), both when Volume is received from the peer:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/-/blob/1a575bb0a708bc455e977629cb99412551867982/src/modules/bluetooth/bluez5-util.c#L614-621

And when sending a new Volume back:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/-/blob/1a575bb0a708bc455e977629cb99412551867982/src/modules/bluetooth/bluez5-util.c#L554-557

These together make it impossible to call ".Set" on a value that is 
identical to the last value received through the "PropertiesChanged" 
signal.  It was made this way to prevent round-trips in the first place, 
as receiving a Volume change and applying it to PA's sink/source would 
also trigger the "volume changed" handler.  Even if the peer decides to 
reply with Volume-1 for every request, there will still be no round-trip.

That is exactly what happens because PA cannot distinguish between 
replies to SetAbsoluteVolume and the ABSOLUTE_VOLUME_CHANGED 
notification caused by button presses, when just looking at the Volume 
property.

Finally, I don't know what PipeWire does.  Someone will have to look 
through the codebase and confirm that it performs the same checks, or 
loop in one of the authors in cc to confirm.  Sonny from CrOS is already 
included to make sure this doesn't break anything on their end.
