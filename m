Hi Hans,

You are right, the VID:PID of the BT adapter on my machine is in that 
file, the autosuspend is enabled by udev instead of kernel. I tested on 
another machine whose BT adapter's ID is not in that file, the 
autosuspend is controlled by btusb.enable_autosuspend=0.

Your reverting patch is correct.

OK, got it. will be careful and will Cc to the original author next time.
