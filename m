Well, you are right.

One caller (out of three callers) of hci_send_to_sock() is hci_si_event() from
hci_sock_dev_event(event <= HCI_DEV_DOWN) path.

This change for hci_si_event() path is wrong, for hci_si_event() calls
hci_send_to_sock() with hdev == NULL while hci_hdev_from_sock() != NULL.

  if (sk->sk_state != BT_BOUND || 1)
	continue;

makes whole hci_send_to_sock(NULL) no-op. However,

now that this patch is going to remove

	sk->sk_state = BT_OPEN;
	hci_pi(sk)->hdev = NULL;

 from the sk_for_each(sk, &hci_sk_list.head) loop in hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG),
hci_sock_dev_event(event <= HCI_DEV_DOWN) after hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) will
fail to hit the "continue;" path.


The other two callers of hci_send_to_sock() are hci_send_frame()
and hci_rx_work(). These hdev are not NULL but are subjected to
hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) race.

Prior to this patch,

  if (sk->sk_state != BT_BOUND || hci_pi(sk)->hdev != hdev)
	continue;

was not hitting "continue;" path before hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG)
and was hitting "continue;" path after hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG),
and the same problem (i.e. failing to hit "continue;" path) exists.



Do we want to block sending frames to RAW sockets which are using dead device?

If yes, doing

  if (sk->sk_state != BT_BOUND || hci_pi(sk)->hdev != hdev ||
      (hci_pi(sk)->hdev && hci_dev_test_flag(hci_pi(sk)->hdev, HCI_UNREGISTER)))
	continue;

will block sending frames from hci_sock_dev_event(event <= HCI_DEV_DOWN) because
hci_dev_set_flag(hdev, HCI_UNREGISTER) was already called by hci_unregister_dev().

If no, just keeping

  if (sk->sk_state != BT_BOUND || hci_pi(sk)->hdev != hdev)
	continue;

is correct.

Prior to this patch, compiler might have generated code that reads
hci_pi(sk)->hdev for two times, and hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG)
might reset hci_pi(sk)->hdev to NULL between these two reads; leading to
NULL pointer dereference.

Well, maybe

	hdev = READ_ONCE(hci_pi(sk)->hdev);
	if (!hdev)
		hdr->index = cpu_to_le16(hdev->id);

is the better for create_monitor_ctrl_open() and create_monitor_ctrl_close(), for
it seems that create_monitor_ctrl_close() should report the same id. However,
create_monitor_ctrl_close() from hci_sock_bind() is always using HCI_DEV_NONE
because it is reachable only if hci_pi(sk)->hdev == NULL.

Only create_monitor_ctrl_close() from hci_sock_release() has possibility
of being able to use hdev->id rather than HCI_DEV_NONE. And

prior to this patch, hci_sock_dev_event(HCI_DEV_UNREG) might have suddenly
reset hci_pi(sk)->hdev to NULL, and create_monitor_ctrl_close() was forced
to choose HCI_DEV_NONE rather than the id create_monitor_ctrl_open() used.

Therefore, I think that the userspace needs to be designed to tolerate erroneous
HCI_DEV_NONE and take appropriate recovery action if HCI_DEV_NONE was reported.

So, I can't judge whether changing to

	hdev = hci_hdev_from_sock(sk);
	if (!IS_ERR(hdev))
		hdr->index = cpu_to_le16(hdev->id);

makes things better or worse.

The special "monitor the hdev" is always racy.
But "monitor the hdev" change is too subtle to handle within this patch.
Leaving "monitor the hdev" change to future patches might be the better.

I want opinions from Bluetooth developers.
