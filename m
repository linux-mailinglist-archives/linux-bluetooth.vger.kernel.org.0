My understanding here derives just from AVDTP spec 5.3 stating that "On successful termination of the configuration procedure, resources in both Device A and Device B shall be allocated (locked), and neither SEP v in Device A nor SEP z in Device B could be configured for another stream connection e.g. by a third device." which seems to forbid it. Maybe this reading is not correct?

It however doesnt't work (see below), and the SelectConfiguration mechanism explicitly skips in-use local endpoints (see avdtp_find_remote_sep), so it appears current code is not consistent on whether to allow it or not.

Technically, the problem is that struct avdtp_local_sep has only the struct avdtp_stream pointer, which just gets overwritten on every SetConfiguration. This later prevents acquiring the transport for the stream whose pointer is not there. stream_free will also set the pointer to NULL, so disconnecting one of the two devices breaks the other.

In principle if this is intended to work, the streams could just be looked up from the streams list instead, and one could just remove the reference in avdtp_stream. Also things like the inuse flag etc. shouldn't be shared, so it seems it needs a bit more work.

Things work when connecting to different adapters, as then the lsep is not the same.


Best,
Pauli
