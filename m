Using strace attached to bluetoothd during a BNEP disconnect/reconnect 
sequence, it looks like the socket that the previous BNEP connection was 
accepted on is not closed.  bluetoothd accepts the new connection on a 
new socket (fd count goes up by one) but never closes the previous 
connection socket.  This is unrelated to the bridge.  That just happens 
to be the first function that tries to create a socket after the fd 
limit is reached.
Increasing the fd limits for the process is not an option (It will 
eventually fail).  This is on a resource limited embedded system.
