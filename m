But we only control the RX/input MTU not the TX/output MTU, so the
headset is at fault here it should have reconfigured the MTU
accordingly. For the RX/input there is a patch already adjusting the
MTU automatically when the socket MTU is set to 0:

commit 4b6e228e297b73451f3a4b12fb7d0b24d9d32e6f
Author: Luiz Augusto von Dentz <luiz.von.dentz@intel.com>

    Bluetooth: Auto tune if input MTU is set to 0

    This enables the code to set the input MTU using the underline link
    packet types when set to 0, previously this would likely be rejected by
    the remote peer since it would be bellow the minimal of 48 for BR/EDR
    or 23 for LE, that way it shall be safe to use 0 without causing any
    side effects.

    This is convenient for the likes of A2DP transport, see:

    https://habr.com/en/post/456182/

Without the remote side updating the MTU the host has no idea of the
changes to the packet type, also we would have to notify the upper
layer of the change if that happens mid stream, this relation between
packet type is not very clear to the L2CAP layer since it doesn't
distinct what data the upper layer is sending so we cannot just do the
MTU change locally and limit the output MTU based on the underline
link, expect perhaps if we would be willing to do that when MTU is set
to 0 in which we would artificially limit the packet length based on
the supported packet types, but does the controller notifies this sort
of change to the host at all?
