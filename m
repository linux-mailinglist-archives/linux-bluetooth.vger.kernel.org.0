Hi, Luiz,
  Thank you for your reply. I just started to study BlueZ. After receiving 
your reply, I reread the code and tested it again with Ubuntu.

First of all, I think this is really a bug. Transfer small file from a 
Windows 10 computer to a Linux computer with a graphical interface via 
Bluetooth. After the transfer, the file cannot be found in the ~/Downloads 
directory of the Linux computer, but the Linux computer has a prompt that 
the file is in the ~/Downloads directory.

Windows uses opp, add use AuthorizePush.

The cache directory is "~/Cache/obexd". In my test, Authorizepush always 
returns this directory; The user specified directory refers to the 
directory specified by the user on the graphical interface, for example, 
in ubuntu, Setting - Bluetooth, there will be a prompt "transferred files 
are placed in the XXXX folder", default is "~/Downloads", You can change it 
to another directory here. obexd stores the received files in the cached 
directory, and after transfer completed, the upper-level program mv files 
to user specified directory.

I first debug this problem on UOS(a linux distribution), the upper-level 
application starts to request the filename after receiving the active 
signal, so there must be this problem.

In ubuntu, first of all i found that it is very difficult to transfer 
files from windows to ubuntu, because AuthorizePush always returns 
forbidden directly. After installed blueman, it is possible to transfer 
files.

I found that ubuntu calls the dbus method to request the name after 
cmd_connect, so that the session->name, that is, the filename, is obtained 
in the place you mentioned above, and there is no path. But in my test, 
ubuntu does not mv the small file to the ~/Downloads directory in most cases, 
and it will be fine after applying my patch. I don't understand the 
upper-level program of ubuntu. I suspect it is related to the active signal?

"~/.cache/obexd" and agent are normal.

This patch won't have the security issues you mentioned, because the added 
signals are all after AuthorizePush returns successfully. My test is that 
before AuthorizePush returns or returns fail, no signal will be emitted and 
file transfer will not start. 

The method is used to request the file name and path. What I mean here is 
that for the upper-level program, if there is a Filename in the dbus signal, 
use this value, otherwise, call the dbus method to get it as before. In ubuntu
(without this patch), the file name is obtained before AuthorizePush returns.
