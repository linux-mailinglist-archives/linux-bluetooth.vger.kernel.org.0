Dear all,

we are communicating with a headset-ish device that offers classic 
bluetooth services and BLE characteristics in parallel.

We have code to talk to the Bluetooth classic part via bluetoothd/dbus, 
and we have code for talking to the BLE parts based on the C-library / 
gatt-client code ; both run in parallel for some time but not 
super-stable, so I'd like to move the code over to a dbus version.

As the device starts advertising BLE characteristics only after a 
classic connection has been established, it appears as a Bluetooth 
classic device on the system bus, and I did not find a way to start GATT 
discovery via the 'official' dbus-API.

I don't fear to tweak bluetoothd nor ~ctl, but would like to know if 
someone already some development going in that direction?

Simon
