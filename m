Looks like there is multiple rounds of MTU Exchange, not sure if that
is actually a problem but the spec does say it shall only be sent once
per client:

BLUETOOTH CORE SPECIFICATION Version 5.3 | Vol 3, Part F
page 1424:

This request shall only be sent once during a connection by the client.

There is also no response to frame #30:
< ACL Data TX: Handle 3585 flags 0x00 dlen 7

                           #30 [hci0] 26.641557
      ATT: Read Request (0x0a) len 2
        Handle: 0x0018

So after 30 seconds (ATT timeout) without receiving any response it disconnects:

< HCI Command: Disconnect (0x01|0x0006) plen 3

                           #48 [hci0] 58.673128
        Handle: 3585
        Reason: Remote User Terminated Connection (0x13)
