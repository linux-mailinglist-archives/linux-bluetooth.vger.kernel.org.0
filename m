Bluetooth has often been a source of spurious wakes in the past. Using
rfkill or masking the wake interrupt were used in the past to make
this more reliable but this was resulting in instability on the
controller (controller needs to drop traffic if host is asleep and
there's no clean way to do that).

The new suspend behavior is the following:
- All devices get disconnected during suspend.
- Only HID devices can wake the device from suspend (i.e. Remote
Wake). The BT controller will be configured to scan (page scan and/or
LE passive scan) based on currently paired devices. If the device is
not configured for wakeup (i.e. power/wakeup in sysfs is "disabled"),
we will not configure this scanning either (see the hdev->prevent_wake
implementation in btusb for an example)
- On resume, devices that support a2dp-sink will be automatically reconnected

This results in more reliable behavior from Bluetooth around suspend
while allowing Remote Wake to work properly.

> 2. I found that the device been disconnected due to suspend won't been auto-connected after resume, shouldn't we get the BT device auto-connected after resume like wifi devices done?

We do this currently only for Bluetooth headphones (reconnect on
a2dp-sink service). I'm not familiar with Obex so I don't know if this
would work for that as well. I did send up a patch making reconnect on
resume configurable based on service uuid that may be relevant to
this: https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/bluetooth/patch/20201207154903.bluez.1.I3e043a481273442748bcff0728b2f0e208017cd2@changeid/

> 3. For the large file transfer, if the BT been disconnected during suspend, the transfer will fail, do we have any methods to avoid this issue?

If you have an active transfer, does it make sense to be suspending?
Perhaps you should hold a wakelock while a transfer is ongoing.
I am not sure how Obex and other services should behave here so I will
defer to Luiz and Marcel's opinion on this topic.
