I'll test the CSIP patchset with the Samsung TWS headset I have. I'm
also going to make the necessary changes to Pipewire, to see how it
works from our side.

FWIW, right now, there are issues in getting reliable BAP audio on this
TWS headset device (with one earbud only currently) --- I'm sending
unframed LC3 packets to the ISO socket with sub-ms timing accuracy (err
~ 0.2ms max, 50us std) and there are still frequent pops in sine wave.
Stuffing extra 2-4 packets to the socket at the start of playback seems
to reduce the problem, so maybe the tx sync issue is suspect.

However, no such problem with nrf5430 or ax210+bluez+pipewire as
receiver, so not really yet clear.

Yes, for RX that's probably what it should be.
