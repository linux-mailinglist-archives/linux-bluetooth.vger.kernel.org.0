it is indeed a bad idea to run an active scan without whitelist when we are going to suspend.

This one I do not get, the passive scan should always be using the whitelist.

An interesting question is really if we need this around the corner path or if it would be done better directly from the kernel to bluetoothd via mgmt socket. So lets explore if we can make this work in a totally generic way that benefits all Linux distros.

I agree that when a system is going to suspend, we should disable any active scanning without whitelist. If we want to differentiate between device allowed to wake us up and device that don’t, then we need to create that list first. Right now we don’t really do that. And I think we don’t have an easy way to tell the kernel via mgmt what this list will be.

> In the suspend done handler, we would do the following in order:

We need to define what discovery is. My understand is that discovery is always user triggered way of actively finding a specific device around you. In most cases because you want to pair with it. The way how mgmt works is that we discovery only for a period of time. And bluetoothd turns it into a continuous discovery as long as a specific UI portion is open and requesting it. Unless discovery has a different meaning, then a simple restart is enough.

Do we need this for classic? I agree that we should abort the inquiry procedure if one is active, but do we really want to deal with the event filter? It is one of these old Bluetooth 1.0b concepts in HCI that are not as well defined as others since you have no idea what the controllers supports and how many devices they support.

I would try to handle this inside the kernel and only add some extra notifications to mgmt so that bluetoothd can be told that we are suspended right now.

It is either support for controller side IRK resolution or forwarding of unresolved directed advertising with RPA. The latter will cause wakeups, but it is limited to directed advertising and will be fine.
