My first guess would be that sixaxis plugin isn't loaded.

Could you provide full bluetoothd log on ev3? One that would include pluging 
in DS3 via USB and then connection attempt over BT (preferably from bluetoothd 
start).

If plugin is loaded, would be good to grab btmon traces from connection 
attempt.
