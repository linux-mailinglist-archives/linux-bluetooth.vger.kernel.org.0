I figured out what the problem was: pulseaudio assumes an MTU of 48
but with this
patch it now ends up being 60, I've left a comment on the pulseaudio MR [1].
After fixing this, audio input and output seem to be working correctly, however
from time to time pulseaudio fails to decode an mSBC packet, but I don't know
whose fault that is.
