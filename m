Thanks, I have implemented and registered the HID profile using 
org.bluez.GattProfile1 and now the device (remote control) re-connects 
automatically.

However, when I enable notifying on the Report characteristics of the 
HID service after I received the first device properties update (with 
services resolved), I miss the first Report event. If I press a button, 
the remote re-connects and dbus events for device properties updated are 
fine, but I don't have a Report event. If I then press again, I do get a 
Report event, because I set notifying on the Report characteristics. 
Setting notify seems to be too late.

What is the trick to get also the first button pressed as a Report 
characteristic event?

At the moment I only have the HID service 
(00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb) in the properties map of the 
org.bluez.GattProfile1.

Thanks,

Martin
