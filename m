Need to check if the text is just information related to how to set
in_use flag or not, afaik there is no test in the testing
specification that do enforce setting the in_use flag since that would
require a third controller in order to do that.

it appears current code is not consistent on whether to allow it or not.

Yep, that would probably need to be changed if we do want to be able
to reuse the same local SEP.

> Technically, the problem is that struct avdtp_local_sep has only the stru=
ct avdtp_stream pointer, which just gets overwritten on every SetConfigurat=
ion. This later prevents acquiring the transport for the stream whose point=
er is not there. stream_free will also set the pointer to NULL, so disconne=
cting one of the two devices breaks the other.

This should be fixed asap since we are probably leaking the data, so
perhaps we can apply these changes and just add a comment that needs
changes if we want to allow the local SEP to be reused.

d up from the streams list instead, and one could just remove the reference=
 in avdtp_stream. Also things like the inuse flag etc. shouldn't be shared,=
 so it seems it needs a bit more work.
