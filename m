so when design the BlueZ 5.x APIs, we on purpose didn’t do this. You are suppose to use doc/profile-api.txt for these kind of things.

I am not in favor of dangling SDP records where we have no lifetime guarantee of the service behind it.

If you look at profiles/iap/main.c then you see how you could write a vendor profile just as easily. That one is the skeleton for iOS accessory protocol over Bluetooth.

These two things are not related and do not belong in the same patch. However what is your goal behind this API since even here we tried not to give raw SDP to the application. It is all baked into the Profile API.
