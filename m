Not really following regarding the dependency on D-Bus, usually shared
don't have dependency on that because the code would be part of the
deamon and in that case you would be better of  testing that direct
via a tester that does exercise its D-Bus API. Lets be clear here,
except for gbus itself all our tests under unit directory are for C
function testing, if you want to test a D-Bus interface then we need a
tester that would do that over D-Bus.

I'd strip the testing for now since it doesn't seem we are on sync to
how we test things apparently.
