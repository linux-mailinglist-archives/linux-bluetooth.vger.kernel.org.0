Hi Christopher,

The term "unique" will vary based on context.  In the context of a
Gatt Service and Characteristic, it is intended to uniquely identify
the "contract" defined by the service/characteristics.  For example a
Temperature Service would have a UUID that universally defines the
contract/interface defined by that service.

So for your custom service, you'll need to define a set of 20 128 bit
UUID (16 bit uuids are reserved for SIG defined uuids) that uniquely
identify the contract that's defined by your service/characteristics.
The devices can uniquely be identified/addressed by their respective
addresses.

I hope this is helpful.

Thanks!
Alain
