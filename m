it might be in general for Linus, but here lets try to keep it at 80.

This check will also catch actually Bluetooth 2.0 and later made devices from CSR.

Keep this as is.

Frankly, I rather add a switch statement and list all the known broken bcdDevice instead of trying to penalize real CSR devices.
