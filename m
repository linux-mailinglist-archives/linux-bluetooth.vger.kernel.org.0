-================
-
-Service		org.bluez
-Interface	org.bluez.Device1
-Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX
-
-Methods		void Connect()
-
-			This is a generic method to connect any profiles
-			the remote device supports that can be connected
-			to and have been flagged as auto-connectable on
-			our side. If only subset of profiles is already
-			connected it will try to connect currently disconnected
-			ones.
-
-			If at least one profile was connected successfully this
-			method will indicate success.
-
-			For dual-mode devices only one bearer is connected at
-			time, the conditions are in the following order:
-
-				1. Connect the disconnected bearer if already
-				connected.
-
-				2. Connect first the bonded bearer. If no
-				bearers are bonded or both are skip and check
-				latest seen bearer.
-
-				3. Connect last seen bearer, in case the
-				timestamps are the same BR/EDR takes
-				precedence.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.NotReady
-					 org.bluez.Error.Failed
-					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
-					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyConnected
-
-		void Disconnect()
-
-			This method gracefully disconnects all connected
-			profiles and then terminates low-level ACL connection.
-
-			ACL connection will be terminated even if some profiles
-			were not disconnected properly e.g. due to misbehaving
-			device.
-
-			This method can be also used to cancel a preceding
-			Connect call before a reply to it has been received.
-
-			For non-trusted devices connected over LE bearer calling
-			this method will disable incoming connections until
-			Connect method is called again.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.NotConnected
-
-		void ConnectProfile(string uuid)
-
-			This method connects a specific profile of this
-			device. The UUID provided is the remote service
-			UUID for the profile.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
-					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
-					 org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotAvailable
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotReady
-
-		void DisconnectProfile(string uuid)
-
-			This method disconnects a specific profile of
-			this device. The profile needs to be registered
-			client profile.
-
-			There is no connection tracking for a profile, so
-			as long as the profile is registered this will always
-			succeed.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
-					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
-					 org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported
-
-		void Pair()
-
-			This method will connect to the remote device,
-			initiate pairing and then retrieve all SDP records
-			(or GATT primary services).
-
-			If the application has registered its own agent,
-			then that specific agent will be used. Otherwise
-			it will use the default agent.
-
-			Only for applications like a pairing wizard it
-			would make sense to have its own agent. In almost
-			all other cases the default agent will handle
-			this just fine.
-
-			In case there is no application agent and also
-			no default agent present, this method will fail.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
-					 org.bluez.Error.Failed
-					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
-					 org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationCanceled
-					 org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationFailed
-					 org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationRejected
-					 org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationTimeout
-					 org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed
-
-		void CancelPairing()
-
-			This method can be used to cancel a pairing
-			operation initiated by the Pair method.
-
-			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist
-					 org.bluez.Error.Failed
-
-Properties	string Address [readonly]
-
-			The Bluetooth device address of the remote device.
-
-		string AddressType [readonly]
-
-			The Bluetooth device Address Type. For dual-mode and
-			BR/EDR only devices this defaults to "public". Single
-			mode LE devices may have either value. If remote device
-			uses privacy than before pairing this represents address
-			type used for connection and Identity Address after
-			pairing.
-
-			Possible values:
-				"public" - Public address
-				"random" - Random address
-
-		string Name [readonly, optional]
-
-			The Bluetooth remote name. This value can not be
-			changed. Use the Alias property instead.
-
-			This value is only present for completeness. It is
-			better to always use the Alias property when
-			displaying the devices name.
-
-			If the Alias property is unset, it will reflect
-			this value which makes it more convenient.
-
-		string Icon [readonly, optional]
-
-			Proposed icon name according to the freedesktop.org
-			icon naming specification.
-
-		uint32 Class [readonly, optional]
-
-			The Bluetooth class of device of the remote device.
-
-		uint16 Appearance [readonly, optional]
-
-			External appearance of device, as found on GAP service.
-
-		array{string} UUIDs [readonly, optional]
-
-			List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available
-			remote services.
-
-		boolean Paired [readonly]
-
-			Indicates if the remote device is paired. Paired means
-			the pairing process where devices exchange the
-			information to establish an encrypted connection has
-			been completed.
-
-		boolean Bonded [readonly]
-
-			Indicates if the remote device is bonded. Bonded means
-			the information exchanged on pairing process has been
-			stored and will be persisted.
-
-		boolean Connected [readonly]
-
-			Indicates if the remote device is currently connected.
-			A PropertiesChanged signal indicate changes to this
-			status.
-
-		boolean Trusted [readwrite]
-
-			Indicates if the remote is seen as trusted. This
-			setting can be changed by the application.
-
-		boolean Blocked [readwrite]
-
-			If set to true any incoming connections from the
-			device will be immediately rejected. Any device
-			drivers will also be removed and no new ones will
-			be probed as long as the device is blocked.
-
-		boolean WakeAllowed [readwrite]
-
-			If set to true this device will be allowed to wake the
-			host from system suspend.
-
-		string Alias [readwrite]
-
-			The name alias for the remote device. The alias can
-			be used to have a different friendly name for the
-			remote device.
-
-			In case no alias is set, it will return the remote
-			device name. Setting an empty string as alias will
-			convert it back to the remote device name.
-
-			When resetting the alias with an empty string, the
-			property will default back to the remote name.
-
-		object Adapter [readonly]
-
-			The object path of the adapter the device belongs to.
-
-		boolean LegacyPairing [readonly]
-
-			Set to true if the device only supports the pre-2.1
-			pairing mechanism. This property is useful during
-			device discovery to anticipate whether legacy or
-			simple pairing will occur if pairing is initiated.
-
-			Note that this property can exhibit false-positives
-			in the case of Bluetooth 2.1 (or newer) devices that
-			have disabled Extended Inquiry Response support.
-
-		string Modalias [readonly, optional]
-
-			Remote Device ID information in modalias format
-			used by the kernel and udev.
-
-		int16 RSSI [readonly, optional]
-
-			Received Signal Strength Indicator of the remote
-			device (inquiry or advertising).
-
-		int16 TxPower [readonly, optional]
-
-			Advertised transmitted power level (inquiry or
-			advertising).
-
-		dict ManufacturerData [readonly, optional]
-
-			Manufacturer specific advertisement data. Keys are
-			16 bits Manufacturer ID followed by its byte array
-			value.
-
-		dict ServiceData [readonly, optional]
-
-			Service advertisement data. Keys are the UUIDs in
-			string format followed by its byte array value.
-
-		bool ServicesResolved [readonly]
-
-			Indicate whether or not service discovery has been
-			resolved.
-
-		array{byte} AdvertisingFlags [readonly, experimental]
-
-			The Advertising Data Flags of the remote device.
-
-		dict AdvertisingData [readonly, experimental]
-
-			The Advertising Data of the remote device. Keys are
-			are 8 bits AD Type followed by data as byte array.
-
-			Note: Only types considered safe to be handled by
-			application are exposed.
-
-			Possible values:
-				<type> <byte array>
-				...
-
-			Example:
-				<Transport Discovery> <Organization Flags...>
-				0x26                   0x01         0x01...
-
-		array{object, dict} Sets [readonly, experimental]
-
-			The object paths of the sets the device belongs to
-			followed by a dictionary which can contain the
-			following:
-
-				byte Rank:
