Update - I managed to make it work with the same live image on my laptop
(before I had tested on my desktop), but first I had to change the USB port=
 it
was connected to. It didn`t work before doing that.=20

On Fedora there`s no hciconfig anymore, and since my laptop already has a
internal bluetooth adapter btmon looks confusing. I made sure to select the
right adapter on blueman and also on bluetoothctl.

I connected my DualShock 4 to my laptop using the adapter and it worked aft=
er
changing USB ports and also I had to try a couple of times.

Gamepad [Wireless Controller] on 00:1a:7d:da:71:10


The 00:1a:7d:da:71:10 address is from the fake bluetooth dongle. The intern=
al
bluetooth uses 54:8C:A0:A8:AC:E0. I`m sure I`m connecting through the right
bluetooth adapter because when I disconnect the dongle the controller gets
disconnected and a bluetoothctl + list only shows the internal adapter.


The question now is why do I have to change USB ports for it to work on my
laptop and why it didn`t work on my desktop with the same live system. I`ll=
 try
once again on my desktop and see if I manage to make it work.
