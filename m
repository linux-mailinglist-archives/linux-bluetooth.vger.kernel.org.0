do you have the btmon trace for this. I think we should accept ERTM on the media channel. The unfortunate part is that control and media channels both use PSM 25 and so we canâ€™t be really selective when we are the acceptor. If MPS wants us to accept ERTM on the media channel we should allow. For all I care we can even accept it on the control channel, but it is just a waste of overhead on the L2CAP headers. Actually the new Enhanced Flow Control mode on BR/EDR would be more efficient for A2DP.

Regards

Marcel
