Thx and aggh. It's vacation time, so sometimes things take longer, but
that doesn't explain why nothing seems to have happened for 9 weeks now
(at least that how it looks from here, but maybe I missed something).

Luiz, what's up here? What do you need to get down to this?

CCing the other Bluetooth maintainers just to be sure. FWIW, the thread
starts here:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/578e6d7afd676129decafba846a933f5@agner.ch/#t

Jan saw similar problems:

Let's see if this prodding helps to get things rolling. If not, I'll
have to get higher level maintainers involved.

Might be wise to create a separate thread for those and asking the
bluetooth maintainers if they might have an idea (please CC the
regressions lists as well), maybe we are lucky; if not someone has to
bisect this to get closer to a solution.
