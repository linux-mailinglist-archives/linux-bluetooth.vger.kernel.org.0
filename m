Hi Spoorthi,

when you initialize the hci_conn structure you have to fill it with the correct default values. The auth payload is not 0x0000 in this case since the controller will already have one that it uses as default. The specification clearly states that Authenticated_Payload_Timeout Default = 0x0BB8 (30 s). This means that one encryption has been activated the LE Ping procedure is active with the default 30s no matter if you send the HCI Write Authenticated Payload Timeout command or not.

Regards

Marcel
