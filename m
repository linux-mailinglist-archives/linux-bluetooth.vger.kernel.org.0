However keep in mind that our inquiry cache is time limited and we through outdated information away. This might cause some race condition. So I rather read the remote host features to ensure we know the actual host features of the remote device.

trying to resolve the name before connected is a waste of time. Resolving the name after connecting will not give you that event. You should just read the remote features.

If you have an idea on how to tighten this and fail, please send a patch. It is just that our inquiry cache was never designed for that. It was just to speed up the connection process.
