Hi Luiz,

I have looked at the differences between the 1.3 and 1.4 specifications, and there is only one meaningful change in the document.

In Section 4.3 AVCTP Message Fragmentation, the following is added at the very end of the last paragraph:
     "The interleaving of the fragments of different packets is not allowed."

Looking in profiles/audio/avctp.c, it appears that fragmented packets are not implemented.  That would imply that there cannot be any interleaving of fragments from different packets.

So, I think that just a version change would work.

So, I was just sort of hoping that it was a version reporting issue (due to the Tizen BlueZ statement above about it using 1.4 8+ years ago) and not something that still needs to be developed.
