There is a leak of "struct l2cap_conn" [2] objects, and of "struct
hci_conn" objects, when a user-mode application scan for a BLE MAC
address, with timeouts [7] [8]. The "struct hci_conn" leak is a
consequence of the first, and we prove it below.

The "struct l2cap_conn" memory leak comes from the
"l2cap_chan_connect()" function.

 1. "l2cap_chan_connect()" [3] calls "l2cap_conn_add(hcon)", which
    allocates a "struct l2cap_conn", sets is reference counter [1] to
    1 and returns it. The "struct l2cap_conn*" is stored in "conn".

 2. "l2cap_chan_connect()" calls "__l2cap_chan_add(conn, chan)" [4],
    which stores "conn" in the "conn" member of "chan":

      chan->conn = conn;

    Since a recent commit [6], "__l2cap_chan_add()" increases the
    "conn" reference counter to 2.

 3. Nothing frees the allocated "struct l2cap_conn". The channel is
    eventually deleted by "l2cap_chan_del()" [5], which sets
    "chan->conn" to NULL and, since a recent commit [6], decreases
    "conn"'s reference counter back to 1.

A recent commit [6] has added reference counting to "chan->conn": the
counter is incremented in "__l2cap_chan_add(conn, chan)", when it is
assigned to the "chan->conn" member, and the counter is decremented in
"l2cap_chan_del()", when the "chan->conn" member is reset to NULL. The
reference counting should free the "struct l2cap_conn", if correctly
used.

The memory allocation error in the current "l2cap_chan_connect()"
comes from a lack of transfer of "struct l2cap_conn" ownership to the
"chan" object. When "l2cap_chan_connect()" calls
"l2cap_conn_add(hcon)", because the latter allocates a "struct
l2cap_conn", the caller receives the responsibility to free it, we
call this "ownership". Because "struct l2cap_conn" is reference
counted, "l2cap_chan_connect()" should either call "l2cap_conn_put()",
or transfer the ownership to a function or object.

Calling "__l2cap_chan_add(conn, chan)" did not, but should transfer
the responsibility to free "conn" to the "chan" channel. The channel
can free "conn" because it stores a reference to it.

This commit fixes the memory leak because it transfers the ownership
from "l2cap_chan_connect()"'s local variable "conn" to the
"conn" member of the "chan" channel.

The ownership transfer is done by decrementing the reference counter
in "l2cap_chan_connect()": "l2cap_chan_connect()" states so it does
not use the "conn" reference any more and does not keep any reference
to the "struct l2cap_conn".

In the no-error case, "l2cap_chan_connect()" has called
"__l2cap_chan_add()", which has taken its own reference and increased
the ref-counter. "l2cap_chan_del()" will eventually drop the channel's
reference and decrement the ref-counter. The reference count will
eventually reach 0, "l2cap_conn_free()" will be called and it will
free the "struct l2cap_conn".

If an error happened between the memory allocation and
"__l2cap_chan_add(conn, chan)", we need to free "conn", which happens
because the "l2cap_conn_put(conn)" is after the "chan_unlock:" and
"release_conn:" labels.

Fixing the "struct l2cap_conn" memory leak fixes the "struct hci_conn"
memory leak. Indeed,

 1. "hci_conn_add()" allocates a "struct hci_conn", and it calls
    "hci_conn_init_sysfs()" that:
     1. initialises the "conn->dev" reference
        counter to 1 with a "device_initialize(&conn->dev)".
     2. registers the "bt_link_release()" callback that will free the
        "struct hci_conn", when the reference counter will reach 0.

 2. Following the "<...>_add()" / "<...>_del()" convention,
    each call to "hci_conn_add()" should be matched by a
    "hci_conn_del()". However, this is not the case for us, because
    we only scan and our use case matches "hci_conn_del()"'s comment:

	/* Remove the connection from the list and cleanup its remaining
	 * state. This is a separate function since for some cases like
	 * BT_CONNECT_SCAN we *only* want the cleanup part without the
	 * rest of hci_conn_del.
	 */
	hci_conn_cleanup(conn);

 3. "hci_conn_cleanup()" will eventually be called, not from
    "hci_conn_del()" but from "le_scan_cleanup()". It will call
    "hci_conn_del_sysfs()" that deletes the device.

 4. There are several "hci_conn_get()" with matching "hci_conn_put()":
     1. "hci_chan_create()" calls "hci_conn_get()" because it sets the
        "conn" field of the "struct hci_chan" it is initialising.
	"hci_chan_create()" is matched by "hci_chan_del()", which
	calls "hci_conn_put()".
     2. "hci_connect_le_scan_remove()" calls "hci_conn_get()". An
        explicit comment explains some cleaning work is deferred to
        the "le_scan_cleanup()" callback, which indeed calls
        "hci_conn_put()".
     3. "l2cap_conn_add()" calls "hci_conn_get()" because it sets the
        "hcon" field of the "struct hci_chan" it is initialising.
	Following the "<...>_add()" / "<...>_del()" convention,
	"l2cap_conn_del()" should match "l2cap_conn_add()". In our use
	case, "l2cap_conn_del()" is never called, and it does not
	contain any "hci_conn_put()" either. The "hci_conn_put()" is
	deferred in the "l2cap_conn_free()" that is eventually called
	when the reference counter in the "struct kref ref" member of
	the "struct l2cap_conn" reaches 0.

In our sources, "l2cap_conn_del()" is called only in
"l2cap_connect_cfm()" and "l2cap_disconn_cfm()", but those callbacks
are never called in our use case.
