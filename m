The tests fail for me in the same on a kernel with and without the
patch:
- Expected that the IUT transmits an L2CAP_ConfigRsp includes the
unsupported option that Lower Tester sent.
Final Verdict:FAIL
L2CAP/COS/CFD/BV-14-C finished

Is this expected? I was using an 5.10-rc7 kernel with and without the
patch I sent. I can send you the full results off-list if you want
them.
