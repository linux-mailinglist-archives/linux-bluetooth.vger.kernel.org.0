I haven't used bluetoothd much but that is what I see:

[mlevitsk@starship ~]$bluetoothctl 
Agent registered
[bluetooth]# scan on
[bluetooth]# scan on
Failed to start discovery: org.bluez.Error.InProgress
[bluetooth]# scan on
Failed to start discovery: org.bluez.Error.InProgress
[bluetooth]# 

No results show up, attempting to scan again shows the InProgres error.

On my AMD laptop on the other hand (also runs the same 5.17-rc5 kernel),
after 'scan on' I start seeing lots of scan results of various devices near me.


journalctl -u bluetooth -b0

I do notice that even on 5.16 kernel, I am not able to use the HSF or whatever low quality bi-directional bluetooh protocol is called for my headset. Used to work, I don't
know what broke it, likely not related to this.

I also updated bluez to 5.6 by installing fedora 33 package, and initiallly it seems to work, but after reboot, the issue shows up again.
Looks like sometimes the scan does work. So far I wasn't able to make it work even once since then.
Reloading btusb doesn't help.
Can't install newer package due to deps on glib sadly. I might be able to compile it from source, but that will take some time to figure
out how the components of the bluez stack are connected together.

For the reference I have 'Intel Corp. AX200 Bluetooth' and I have the same device on my AMD laptop and both have USB ID 8087:0029
My AMD laptop has Fedora 34 though.

Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
