it is fine to do this as the first command, but it needs to happen after read info. Also mgmt_send should nicely queue commands.

When I received them, you had single space and not tabs in it.

I am fine with you sending the mgmt-tester change as second patch when the support is added to bluetoothd. I am also fine if you just send a patch to add the mgmt.h changes. Your choice. I just don’t want to intermix patch for different subdirectories if it is not needed.
