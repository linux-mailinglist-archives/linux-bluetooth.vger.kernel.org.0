  pbap: Support calling pbap_init() after pbap_exit()

pbap_exit() didn't previously unregister itself thoroughly.  That
was fine if it was only called when the service was about to exit,
because everything was implicitly unregistered when the process ended.
But we need to be more scrupulous if this can be called throughout
the program's lifecycle.

Send the UnregisterProfile message directly from pbap_exit(),
then call unregister_profile().

The UnregisterProfile message can't be sent directly from
unregister_profile(), because that also needs to be called when
register_profile() fails halfway through.

Do not free profiles in bluetooth_exit() - profiles are needed
by a future call to bluetooth_init(), or will be freed by
bluetooth_stop() if necessary.

  obex: unregster profiles when the user is inactive

Obexd is usually run as a user service, and can exhibit surprising
behaviour if two users are logged in at the same time.

Unregister profiles when the user is detected to be off-seat.

It may be impossible to detect whether a user is on-seat in some cases.
For example, a version of obexd compiled with systemd support might be
run outside of a systemd environment.  Warn and leave services
registered if that happens.

Obexd can be run as a system service, in which case this check makes no
sense.  Disable this check when called with `--system-bus`.

Obexd can also be run by a user that does not have an active session.
For example, someone could use `ssh` to access the system.  There might
be a use case where someone needs Bluetooth access but can't log in with
a keyboard, or there might be a security issue with doing so.  This isn't
handled explicitly by this patch, but a future patch could add support
by calling `logind_set(FALSE)` in the same way as is currently done
with `--system-bus`.

Based in large part on the wireplumber code mentioned by Pauli Virtanen:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/blob/master/modules/module-logind.c#L52

Other services are likely to need similar functionality,
so I have created a gist to demonstrate the basic technique:

No longer needed now services can share resources.
