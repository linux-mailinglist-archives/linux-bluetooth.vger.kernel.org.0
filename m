added by a Broadcast Assistant and to acquire them one by one to receive
the streams.

  profiles/avdtp: Fix reply for bad media transport format

Currently the avdtp_setconf_cmd() fails to check the capability length
of the Media Transport Service Category, which should be 0, because
caps_to_list() doesn't add it to the list of services as it should
be bigger than packet boundary.

This commit adds an &err parameter to caps_to_list() and set the error
to AVDTP_BAD_MEDIA_TRANSPORT_FORMAT if Media Transport capability as
invalid length.

This is required for passing AVDTP/SNK/ACP/TRA/BTR/BI-01-C PTS test
case:
To verify that the IUT (ACP) is able to issue a set configuration
reject response to the INT if the format of the media transport is
incorrect.

  adapter: Preserve pending flags when setting the Device Privacy Mode

If there are already flags that are pending to be applied, we should
keep them to avoid overwriting them.
At that point we only want to add the Device Privacy Mode on top of the
existing flags.

  device: Preserve pending flags when setting the wake allowed

If there are already flags that are pending to be applied, we should

In device_set_wake_allowed() we only want to either add or remove the
remote wakeup flag, while keeping the existing flags as-is.

  device: Try to set the wake_allowed property only for bonded devices

When the function `device_set_wake_support()` is called, we don't have
the guarantees for the device to be already bonded.

For example, that function gets called by `hog_probe()`, that is also
triggered when bluez scans for new devices. In that instance, we don't
want to try setting the `wake_allowed` property, because those devices
are only in range of the host and are not connected, paired or bonded
yet.

This fixes the following Bluez error when we scan for new devices and a
new hog or hid is in range:
```
src/device.c:set_wake_allowed_complete() Set device flags return status:
Invalid Parameters
```

Additionally, because that initial `device_set_allowed()` call can fail,
this commit fixes the issue of hog and hid devices that, after the first
pairing, were unexpectedly showing `WakeAllowed: no`. And it required a
reboot to let that property be set to the expected `WakeAllowed: yes` by
default.

This change is required for passing below testcases-

   MAS-instance to the MCE
2. MAP/MSE/MMN/BV-06-C
   Verify that the MSE correctly responds to a request

We are adding the raw skeleton implementaton for PTS certification.
Although the functionality can be added later as per requirement.

request if the MSE declares support for the feature MapSupportedFeatures
in Connect Request in its SDP record.

If Server's SDP record contains the field 'MapSupportedFeatures in Connec=

Request' as supported then include the supported features
apparam in obex connect request.

  client/gatt: Fix pointer assigned with character literal

A character literl, '\0', is assigned to the pointer. The corresponding
comment doesn't make any sense, since '\0' represents zero and this
statement does the same thing as assigning value with NULL.

Initializing value with NULL (or zero) is safe and correct here: the
only case that the initial value of the pointer is passed to
write_value() is that the if branch isn't executed, where len keeps its
initial value, zero, as well. With src_len equal to zero, write_value()
will bail out and src_val won't be dereferenced.

Let's clean up the misleading comment and change right side of the
assignment to fix compiler warnings about the wrong type,

 iterator")
