Hmm I believe we can extract the build number of the firmware, I mean
it is obviously in there and we could possibly start encoding its
version/build as part of the filename as well not just the model.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git/tree/drivers/bluetooth/btintel.c#n226
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git/tree/drivers/bluetooth/btusb.c#n2723

So we just have to figure out where the build number is in the
firmware file, so store it somewhere else perhaps using some metadata
perhaps.
