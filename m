I'd keep the initial logic of sending the advertisement immediately
since the likes of mgmt-tester, and other testers, do have a number of
tests that connect so adding a delay can probably cause us to spend
more time waiting.

Btw, make sure you run the testers to confirm you are not breaking any
kernel testers.
