Hi Luiz,

Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

That was my bad. I just checked. Our system is Ubuntu 18.04. The BlueZ
version is "5.48-0ubuntu3.4" which is different from the versions in
http://www.bluez.org/. I'm trying to figure out if this version
includes the version 5.50. Do you know the corresponding BlueZ version
for "5.48-0ubuntu3.4"?

Thanks!
Kenny

We looked at the log. When the app tries to read temperature by using the t=
emperature UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received the requ=
est to read the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device name" is re=
turned to the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavior as =
the bluetooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/bluetooth/[B=
T_MAC]/cache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files in th=
e folder. That means the disabled cache seems working.
