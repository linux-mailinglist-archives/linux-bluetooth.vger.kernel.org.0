Hi Daniel,

I would prefer to directly return Selected_TX_Power value since then you know for sure that the controller has chosen one or does not support it (for that use -127 / TX_POWER_INVALID as value). It has the advantage that you clearly know what you have. Otherwise we have to wait and hope for an event that might come or might not come. Meaning we have to start a timer in userspace and handle the case when it doesn’t come. So I think just return the value and we set it to INVALID if we don’t have it.

>> I was thinking we rename Read Security Information Command and also return these values there. I think it is a bit of waste to introduce yet another command to return controller capabilities.

Maybe we keep it simple as “Read Controller Features” command.
