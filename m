Yes, I can maintain this new daemon.

Only one application can register to bluez and "own" bluez socket for
communication with bluetooth headset. Currently it can be either
pulseaudio (with native backend in pulseaudio for HSP profile) or ofono
(with ofono backend in pulseaudio for HFP profile).

So if hsphfpd would be in use, then ofono would not be able to get
socket from bluez. And it would be needed to add a new "plugin" into
ofono to use hsphpfd for telephony operations. See hsphfpd.txt file
(there is diagram of usage).

Always from hsphfpd.

Internally they are handled by hsphpfd directly and appropriate API is
exported via DBus for audio application daemon (pulseaudio). For details
see hsphfpd.txt file, interface org.hsphfpd.AudioTransport.

I do not know if bluez developers are interested in having this code as
part of bluez project, specially when in bluez4 HFP profile was there
and in bluez5 was HFP code completely removed.

But it should not matter where hsphpfd is implemented.

It is just a prototype. I used Perl just because it is faster for me to
implement parsing of AT commands needed for prototype purposes.
