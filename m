Hi Pali,

Please think some more about what I said.  You will need to parse every 
AT command in your daemon, no way around that.  You are right that you 
do not need to keep track of the telephony state, but that is besides 
the point.  So if you need an AT parser anyway, the whole reasoning for 
the proposed architecture starts to look shaky.

Again, you're not addressing my main point.  Codec negotiation is part 
of SLC establishment.  SLC has both telephony and audio aspects. 
They're inseparable.  Your architecture fails to address this...

CSR codecs are not part of SLC and can be bolted on later.  I already 
told you that oFono can easily be changed to support this.

So again, no reason for us to get involved :)

Bottom line is there's no value for us in this architecture.  If you 
want to use the existing oFono APIs, that's fine.  But we're not adding 
a plugin for taking arbitrary AT commands from some other daemon :)

Start a separate thread on ofono for this.  I already gave you hints on 
how to solve the 'AG without a real modem' use case.  That would seem to 
be the biggest 'win' and it should be fairly easy to make this work.

HSP is a separate issue.  Maybe we can handle it like the 'dundee' 
daemon inside oFono (which handles Bluetooth DUN profile).  In other 
words have a dedicated daemon for hsp support that reuses the relevant 
bits of oFono and maybe exposes the same APIs (i.e the ones documented 
in doc/handsfree-audio-api.txt).  That would make life for PulseAudio 
pretty easy.
