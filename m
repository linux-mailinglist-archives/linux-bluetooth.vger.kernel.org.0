Hi Alain,

can please prefix the subject with “Bluetooth: “ then I have to stop fixing it up after applying ;)

> With this change, the encryption key size is not assumed to be 16 if the

	/* When the command to read the encryption key size fails, then this

So I wouldn’t scrap the comment. I would extend it to something like above. Feel free to copy it or reword or use your own words. I just want a comment there that when I read the code in 6 month from now, I remember why this is done.

Regards

Marcel
