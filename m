As the user who originally reported thes issue, I can confirm this. I 
was introduced to this regression because I use Fedora Rawhide on my 
laptop, which builds and pushes kernels based on mainline very regularly.

Here is my description of the regression: After the reverted change, the 
BT hardware in my laptop (qca6390) will only work after a cold boot when 
the hardware has only be enabled once by the driver. Once the hardware 
is enabled, the process of disabling/re-enabling fails. Also, the 
hardware cannot be enabled after a warm boot of the laptop.

Among other things, this makes logging into KDE Plasma break my 
bluetooth mouse. The cause of this breakage appears to be that Plasma 
disables/re-enables bluetooth hardware upon login.

GNOME operates slightly less badly in that bluetooth stays enabled. 
However, if I manually disable the bluetooth via the ui or by restarting 
the bluetooth service with systemctl, the mouse fails in the same way as 
happens with Plasma.

Once the bluetooth has failed, the only way to fix is a cold boot and 
only enable the hardware once. I cannot remove the modules (btqca, 
hci_uart, and bluetooth) and re-modprobe them to fix it. I can't restart 
the bluetooth service. I can't do both of those things. I haven't found 
any way to re-enable the hardware beyond cold boot with bluetooth 
service enabled.

If I disable the bluetooth service and cold boot the laptop, there also 
appears to be some kind of race condition as not enabling bluetooth 
service very soon after loading the hci_uart and btqca modules during 
boot puts the system in a state where I can never enable bluetooth. I do 
not know what causes this specifically, but my theory is that not 
starting the bluetooth service immediately puts the driver in a similar 
state as when the service is started immediately. Maybe some kind of 
lazy initialization that is forced to happen more quickly when the 
bluetooth service is enabled?

Any way, this reversion by itself (which I manually did after a 
discussion with Zijun before getting his test patches applying to my 
kernel for test). However, this reversion did not get the hardware 
working after a warm boot.

I can confirm this. Without this change (and with the #1 change), I can 
cold boot the laptop and disable/re-enable the hardware as many times as 
I want. However, warm booting will not allow the hardware to work. I 
believe that a similar problem existed before the 6.8 kernel (if memory 
serves), as I had been having issues of this sort for some time. I was 
able to reproduce a similar issue as far back as 5.19. I tested that and 
every intervening release until 6.8.0. I did not realize that the warm 
boot problem was separate from the enable/disable issue until working 
with Zijun.

It was Zijun who realized that #1 and #2 these were two separate but 
related issues. He really dug in and found the problem and produced test 
patches. It was impressive, and he should be given credit for finding 
that these were the issues so quickly.

The only reason I'm involved here is that I am squeaky wheel that 
happened to be running Rawhide and got hurt by the kernel. I am a 
glorified beta tester who got unlucky, and I was hoping the find help in 
the kernel community. Zijun stepped up.

The only other thing that I am wondering about this patch set is if 
Zijun or some other party should be listed as the maintainer of the 
btqca module and hci_qca.c and btqca.* files so that they can be found 
more easily with the get_maintainer.pl script.
