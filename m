However it is not practical since the controller would have to re-encode in case a different air codec is used. The reality is that all “legacy” devices decided for CVSD air codec and PCM host codec.

It is simple. If hw encoder is poor you can write your own in software.
Then you can compare audio quality of hw encoder in adapter and software
encoder in userspace.

I'm sure that people are interested even in increasing quality of CVSD
transport and they can spend time on own userspace codec.

I understand that it does not bring any value for you and it can be a
waste of time for you.

But please do not block research in this field which can be done by
other people independently of you.

The worst what can happen is that (independent) researcher just confirms
what you have wrote. But even this would be very positive conclusion!

Yes, it is unclear and therefore research in this field by other people
can be interesting. To know what is reality.

I'm not saying that you have to use it. My argument is to allow other
people to do it and do not block them.

Yes, it is transparent, but with different parameters which needs to be
passed to Setup Synchronous Connection parameters. And because this
codec is SW, encoding and decoding is done in software, userspace must
be able to "tune" parameters for Setup Synchronous Connection command.

Without it, it is not possible to use AuriStream codec, even it is
Transparent.

Ok, I understand that you do not like alaw and ulaw codecs. But do not
block usage of AuriStream. This codec is supported by many headsets and
has better quality than CVSD (which is currently supported by kernel).

Also, please keep in mind that alaw and ulaw codecs are
telecommunication standards and these codecs are still used.

People leaving in Europe and working in telecommunication sector would
know that alaw is codec main voice codec for audio PSTN calls and is
used also in VOIP lines.

So even if you marked it as legacy, it does not mean that it is not
used. Yes, it is legacy, but it is still there and tons of voice calls
in Europe are encoded in alaw.

But at least, please do not blok usage of AuriStream codec by Linux
kernel. People are complaining about bad quality, AuriStream can improve
it, but this decision just say "we do not want improvement".

I was open for any discussion how to bring it, but for one year I have
received any positive reaction how to achieve it. I designed API which
would allow it but there was no discussion about it, how to either
improve it or something else.

There is no need for alaw and ulaw in Bluetooth. Period. And CVSD is used as legacy air codec and that is it.
