With no acknowledgement from Luiz yet I've gone ahead and added an 
experimental `uint16 SetVolume(uint16)` call to "MediaTransport1" to 
start testing this behaviour. You can find the commits here:

https://github.com/MarijnS95/bluez/commits/master

This has only been tested with dbus-send, the PA changes still have to 
be written.  Given the original review on Sonny's patches we might want 
to replace the allocation with `pending` members on the session instead, 
so that we can possibly do some debouncing if multiple .Set calls 
arrive.  Seems like we need three members then:

volume: 	current known volume between BlueZ and the peer.
pending_volume: an active AVRCP SetAbsoluteVolume call is in progress
		with this value.  Though this could also be a non-null
		DBusMessage *volume_reply; as we don't need the
		requested volume anymore.
next_volume:	a client already queued a new value through .Set, while
		SetAbsoluteVolume (pending_volume != -1) is still in
		flight.

While putting this together I noticed that manually calling `.Set 
"MediaTransport1" "Volume" XX` doesn't notify other applications.  What 
happens is that `a2dp->volume` is set to the actual volume (in 
set_volume), and no "PropertiesChanged" is emitted unless we're in 
"notify" mode ("we are the headphones").  Then, as soon as the peer 
replies (avrcp_handle_set_volume, media_transport_update_device_volume, 
media_transport_update_volume) we see that `a2dp->volume == volume` and 
never emit "PropertiesChanged" either, leaving all other clients unaware 
of the change.

This seems simply addressed by not setting `a2dp->volume` set_volume() 
and instead rely on that to happen in avrcp_handle_set_volume, just like 
I'm doing in the handler for this new SetVolume function.
That might already solve your problem in CrOS, by simply waiting for a 
property change notification before sending the next volume change.  We 
however won't be able to distinguish it from a button-press on the 
headphones by the user, but I'm not entirely sure anymore if that's 
still needed.

Marijn

PS: Since these messages seem to come through, Luiz have you received my 
patch to address AVRCP Absolute Volume missing when connected to Android 
phones?
