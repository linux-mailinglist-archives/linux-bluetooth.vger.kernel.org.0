Hi Richard,

It is still marked as 1.3:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/profiles/audio/avrc=
p.c#n409

That said I don't think there is much difference, well we better check
what was incorporated with these erratas:

1.4 Bluetooth AVCTP Protocol Change History
1.4.1 Changes from 1.3 to 1.4
1.4.1.1 General Changes
=EF=82=B7 Incorporation of adopted changes to correct various errata. Relev=
ant
errata are
733, 2689.

If Tizen qualified it for 1.4 it is most likely just a version change
that needs to be made, from 0x0103 to 0x0104.
