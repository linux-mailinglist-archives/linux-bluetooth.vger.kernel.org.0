since with BR/EDR they keys are always a result of a key agreement function, I think this is just that. Frankly you will not be able to end up with a LK blacklist. Same as for LE pairing with ECDH, you will not end up with a LTK blacklist. This is pretty much just LE legacy pairing LTKs and IRKs.

So for the keys are a generated by a key agreement function, lets not go overboard. Even the re-keying will be safe.

The only case where you can have this for LK and LTK if they are distributed out-of-band (without the spec defined out-of-band pairing) and systems just using that key. I have not seen a system doing that in all the years.

With my comment above, I think we can even neglect this one as well.

This more a personal taste. I am a big fan of readable code and let the compiler do the optimization. We want to stay below 80 chars in width. And that means you have only 6 indentation. I also prefer limited multi-line function calls. So if you look at the codebase right now, we have preferred keeping code as less indented as possible to allow for an easy read-flow through a function.

Sure, but the main user is bluetoothd and I assume you got the code right there. If there is another userspace around and too stupid to get this right, they most likely will fix it quickly.

In principle I am with you. However I also prefer that BR/EDR and LE works similar. If we behave a certain way on one bearer, we should do the same on the other. So how does this compare in this case?

I would do it for practical reasons in this case. The storage for controller resolving is limited and I rather not waste space in the controller for a key that is blacklisted.

Fine. Just wanted to raise it.

Fair point.
