at said, while the device may be non-compliant, the device is on the market=
 and I doubt I could get them to update the firmware as a random third part=
y. It works on Windows, so clearly Windows doesn't have a problem with its =
noncompliance. So this raises the question, how should Linux handle non-com=
pliant hardware, especially when it could easily be made to work just by be=
nding the rules in this one instance? I can absolutely change the commit me=
ssage since it's erroneous, but the question then comes down to how should =
it be handled at all.

Windows, so there probably won't be a firmware update" reply, despite its n=
oncompliance. And since I doubt Windows will add a change to limit it, well=
, that kind of limits our options here to either "enforce compliance and br=
eak non-compliant hardware" or "figure out a way to bend the rules". Given =
that BlueZ, upon expanding the maximum size, does successfully read the ove=
rly-long report map (it does use the read blob with offset message to get t=
he last several bytes), it does work as intended if we ignore that specific=
 rule. Though obviously that's up to the bluetooth maintainers to solve, so=
 at this point I'm just tossing my two cents at it.

Well we can do what Windows is doing but let's have it documented
then, we could as well scalate this with Bluetooth SIG since the
manufacturer seem to be intentionally creating interoperability
problems with a standard service, but that would likely take a lot
more time and most likely will need to be resolved by introducing a
test that enforces that HoG client don't attempt to read past 512
bytes offset.

Btw, if there is no limitation on how big the report map can get in
HID, I'd leave it up to the kernel to figure out if that is acceptable
or not, so I'd remove the 1024.
