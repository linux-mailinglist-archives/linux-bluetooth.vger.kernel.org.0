Hi Jamie, Luiz,

Thanks for your info.

Luiz, to answer your questions:
BlueZ doesn't seem to emit "Service Changed Indication". Or it does
emit it, but we don't know how to verify it.
Yes, BlueZ acts as a GATT server which runs on Linux.

So my questions:
How can I tell if "Service Changed Indication" is working? I need to
show it to our app developers that the GATT server does send the
"Service Changed Indication" when there is a service change.
By disabling the GATT's cache in "/etc/bluetooth/main.conf", the
"Service Changed Indication" is disabled?
Can "Service Changed Indication" be enabled in a conf file? Or should
it be done in the Python code? Could you please help find out that
info?
Our GATT server is based on the Python code
examples(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/test).
I don't know how to enable "Service Changed Indication" or "Robust
Caching" in Python code on the GATT server side. There is no document
or code samples about that. Please let me know if there is any
document or Python code example.

Thanks!
Kenny

It was purposely designed for this specific purpose, you're trying to work =
around an issue created because you don't want to use the feature that prev=
ents this issue. Any workaround is just that, a workaround, and might not w=
ork as intended.

n we upgrade the build from 100 to 101, the app gets the wrong data. We loo=
ked at the log. When the app tries to read temperature by using the tempera=
ture UUID, somehow the bluetooth service we created received the request to=
 read the "device name"(device name UUID). So the "device name" is returned=
 to the app as the temperature. This looks like the same behavior as the bl=
uetooth cache is not disabled. I looked at the "/var/lib/bluetooth/[BT_MAC]=
/cache" folder. There is no "[Attributes]" section in the files in the fold=
er. That means the disabled cache seems working.
