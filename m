L2CAP_CREDIT_BASED_RECONFIGURE_REQ, which allows for the MTU to be changed =
after it has been established. This requires an enhanced ATT service howeve=

EATT is meant to allow multiple outstanding requests, it probably
would not escale if we would add an API to have a bearer per
application so we just use the extra bearers as a pool.

This is kind of an artificial limitation that the author decided to
impose on the bearer, but if it was adopted like that so be it.
