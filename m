At least it somehow works for you ! I just recently got one in attempt to
"upgrade" from 2.1 to 4.0 (also 0a12:0001) and have a spare for my Sony
DualShocks 3&4. It works under Windows but I don't actually remember if I
managed to successfully test it under Linux. Under kernel 5.2.8 bluez acts if
it wasn't there but in reality it fails with this ridiculous "Delete Stored
Link Key: Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value". btusb does not have 'quirks'
option and adding 'quirks=0a12:0001:HCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_STORED_LINK_KEY' to
usbcore doesn't seem to be doing anything.

But neither you or me are going to use that patch because BT stack was
completely rewritten and its logic is completely different now. If developers
don't want to ignore failures to initiate such "important" optional functions
and enable quirks automatically on pre-init sanity check then at least someone
could have said somewhere how to enable the damn things at runtime without
hard-coding IDs of your random noname dongles into kernel's codeâ€¦

How the hell people are using those BT quirks ?
