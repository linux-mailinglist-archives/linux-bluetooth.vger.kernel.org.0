I fully agree.

This type of product has indeed been launched on the market. Based on my 
tests, the own addr type bit in the broadcast of the peripheral device 
is set to 0x01, which corresponds to a Random Device address, and the 
address remains consistent with the BREDR address.
When I modify the own addr type in the broadcast of the peripheral 
device to 0, the iPhone (iOS) will then treat them as one device.

Own_Address_Type
Value Parameter Description
0x00 Public Device Address (default)
0x01 Random Device Address
0x02 Controller generates Resolvable ...
0x03 Controller generates Resolvable ...
