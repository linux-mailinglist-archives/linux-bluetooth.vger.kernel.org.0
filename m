we can have simple logic such as if only hid is added (via the flag, we use=
 the smaller duty cycle provided by the hid parameters defined in this patc=
h), else, we use the passive scanning parameters as we do today. In essence=
, with this logic, no aggregation of settings is necessary since it is up t=
o the platform who set the various values via their .conf file.

So the intend is to switch passive scanning 'modes', perhaps Im
missing an API or policy to do that, or is the indend to do this
automagically? It is a little bit hard to follow given that a system
can have many different peripherals, each with different scanning
requirements, or the idea is to apply HID mode only if there are HID
devices paired?
