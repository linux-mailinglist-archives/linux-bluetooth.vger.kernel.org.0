We never had an intention that the kernel otherwise can power up/down the c=
ontroller as it pleases.

Aside from the powered setting, the stack is resilient to the
controller crashing (which would be akin to a power off and power on).
From the view of bluez, adapter lost and power down should be almost
equivalent right? ChromeOS has several platforms where Bluetooth has
been reset after suspend, usually due USB being powered off in S3, and
the stack is still well-behaving when that occurs.

+Chin-Ran Lo and +Amitkumar Karwar (added based on changes to
drivers/bluetooth/btmrvl_main.c)

Could you please take a look at the original cover letter and comment
(or add others at Marvell who may be able to)? Is this a known issue
or a fix?

That sounds reasonable. I have landed this within ChromeOS so we can
test whether a) this improves stability enough and b) whether the
power off/on in the kernel has significant side effects. This will go
through our automated testing and dogfooding over the next few weeks
and hopefully identify those side-effects. I will re-raise this topic
with updates once we have more data.

Also, in case it wasn't very clear, I put this behind a module param
that defaults to False because this is so heavy handed. We're only
using it on specific Chromebooks that are exhibiting the worst
behavior and not disabling it wholesale for all btmrvl controllers.

Thanks
Abhishek
