  client/player: Add support to set empty bcode

A Broadcast Sink might scan encrypted streams, and the user might not
know the Broadcast Code to decrypt them.

This commit adds the option to set an empty Broadcast Code when prompted
for it after transport.select, if the Code is unknown. In this case, if
the Broadcast Sink is acting as a Scan Delegator, it can ask its peer
Broadcast Assistants to provide the Code through BASS.

  shared/bass: Add API to set BIG enc state

This adds a shared/bass API to set the BIG encryption state field inside
a Broadcast Receive State characteristic. Notifications are then sent to
inform all peers about the update.

  bass: Add support to request bcode

This adds support for a Scan Delegator to request the Broadcast Code
from peer Broadcast Assistants and to update a BAP stream QoS with the
value.

A BASS API is added to update the BIG encryption status of a Broadcast
Receive State characteristic and to notify peers. When a peer provides
the Code using the BASS "Set Broadcast Code" operation, the BAP stream
QoS is updated. The driver calling this API will pass a callback as
parameter, which will be called to signal that the Broadcast Code has
been received and stored in the stream QoS.

A timeout is set to wait for Broadcast Assistants to provide the Code.
If the timeout expires, the callback will be code with the appropriate
error status.

  shared/bass: Set correct BIG enc state after sync

A Scan Delegator might set the BIG encryption state of a Broadcast
Receive State characteristic to "Broadcast Code Required", to notify
Broadcast Assistants that the value is needed to decrypt the streams.

If the Broadcast Code was received and BIG sync was established, the
BIG encryption state must be transitioned to "Decrypting" state, to
inform Assistants that BIG sync was successfully established with the
correct Code.

  transport: Add support to request bcode from Assistant

A Broadcast Sink might scan an encrypted stream, but the user might
not know the Broadacst Code to decrypt it. However, if the Broadcast
Sink is acting as a Scan Delegator, it can request the Code from
Broadcast Assistants.

This adds support to ask for the Broadcast Code through BASS, if an
empty Code was entered by the user at transport select.

The bluetoothctl log below shows a Scan Delegator creating a media
transport for an encrypted BIS added by a Broadcast Assistant through
the Add Source operation. The user is asked to enter the Broadcast Code
at transport.select, and the "no" option is chosen, since the Code is
unknown. However, the Code is received from the Broadcast Assistant and
the transport is successfully acquired.

  transport: Delay existence based on delay reporting capability

In case when the existence of the delay property is based on its value
not being zero it is not possible to read the delay if sink sets it to
zero on purpose (or it was not updated by the sink at all). However,
client might expect it to be readable, if SEP reports delay reporting
as available.

Instead of checking the value, we should check the capabilities of
the AVDTP stream. Also, by doing that we can allow this property to
be writable in the future - the exists() callback is used in the
properties_set() function as well.
