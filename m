Yeah I'd check for the TG version (done before that patch) and
FEATURE_CATEGORY_2 here, but the patch clearly mentions that there's no
target to begin with.  This seems counter-intuitive and more like a
fluke (maybe the SDP cache got of date, or the device dynamically
"un"-publishes this record) and without knowing what device this was
happening on it's very hard to validate if/whether this is still valid.

I totally agree that all these edge-cases should use extra comments to
detail what's going on, and I like the idea of hiding them behind config
flags.  That way we can pass validation without worries and at the same
time give distros and individuals the ability to be less strict, though
we'll have to think about the default value for for example this AOSP
workaround.

Based on your suggestion I'll also move absolute volume control without
target SDP record behind a similar flag, and add Yu Liu to the CC here
to see if we can get some more clarification. Yu, can you detail what
device this was happening on, and if this is still the case?  Thanks!
