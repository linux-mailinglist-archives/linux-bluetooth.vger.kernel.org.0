This has been there for a while but if I recall correctly the problem
is that we cannot really tell when the auto-connect was disabled,
besides it was not really honoring that in case the daemon is
restarted, etc, so instead of having yet another setting to persist it
was simpler to just use the trust, or block, properties to control
auto-connect which are persisted properly, that said maybe we can make
disconnect auto block the device and then connect to unblock
automatically but I think that having the application set the block
property is probably clearer that we don't want it to be reconnected.
