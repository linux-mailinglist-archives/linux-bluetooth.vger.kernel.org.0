Hi Luiz,

> This makes btusb to queue ACL and events during a polling interval

> where frames received from different endpoints are considered to be
> arrived at same time and then attempt to resolve potential conflics by
> processing the events ahead of ACL packets.

> It worth noting though that priorizing events over ACL data may result

> instance there may be packets received before a disconnect event that
> will be discarded and unencrypted packets received before encryption
> change which would considered encrypted, because of these potential
> changes on the order the support for queuing during the polling
> interval is not enabled by default so it requires setting
> force_poll_sync debugfs while the adapter is down.
