Interesting, what is the presentation delay configured, in theory that
should be used to synchronize the streams, we may need a way to
measure this latency and attempt to compensate for it somehow if
transfer speed variates.

I believe we fixed that, are you running with the latest firmware and
bluetooth-next? On the kernel side you may need the following:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.gi=
t/commit/?id=3D70eff70d453bdb529d8233f59e32c1ffedac7685

This might be hard to figure out without air traces, will need to
reproduce it internally.

Make sure you have btmon to collect the traces when this happens.

Ive seen that, this may actually be something like:

https://github.com/bluez/bluez/issues/340#issuecomment-1494877679

This is less pronounced when we use the auto-connect list, since that
attempts to connect whenever it sees the device advertising so it will
continue to attempt multiple times, with the latest bluez tree this is
now the default behavior:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/commit/?id=3Dca07d198f9c=

Yeah, I think there will be some time needed to mature the stacks and
firmware to match what we currently have in Classic, but it is great
to have this sort of feedback from the audio subsystem.
