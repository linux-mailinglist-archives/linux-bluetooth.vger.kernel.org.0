Hi Marcel,

I am okay with Types =3D ["le", "bredr"]. However, I don't understand
why a user should be able to change the Type, since this property
describes the fact about a peer device, not a local adapter. What does
it mean by a user changing the type of a peer device? Also, I don't
understand why HS needs to be considered in that property, since I see
org.bluez.Device1 objects as discovered devices either through Inquiry
(in which case it'd be "bredr") or Advertisement (in which case it'd
be "le"), or both. HS seems to be one of remote features rather than a
type. Also the HS information is also not readily available in the
struct btd_device, or even src/device.c, which suggests that it has
been treated differently.

> maybe we should do SupportedTypes =3D [=E2=80=9Cle=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cbre=
dr=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Chs=E2=80=9D] since that also maps to what we expose i=
n MGMT. And then add a Types =3D [ .. ] property with the same values. I do=
n=E2=80=99t like using GAP in property names and repeating Device is also n=
ot needed since we are already in the Device interface. In addition I have =
a reservation with spec naming in this area since it has changed over time =
and there is a chance it might change again in future specs when new featur=
es come along.

 to show it. If you wanted to, you could make the Types property writeable =
as well and users could change their device type via D-Bus.
