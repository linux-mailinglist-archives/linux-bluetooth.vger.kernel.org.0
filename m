unless they are high severity issues that are remotely exploitable to gain root access, I personally have no problem if they are reporting directly to the public mailing list.

For example we have test utilities and development utilities that donâ€™t normally run in production systems. We will fix every issue reported, but they are just bugs and not security issues.
